"The doctor never asked why she had an infection, but I do know that for years she had it treated with Antifungal Gel, which is very effective. I believe that it is often given in capsules, but it is not always. One night I noticed a strange green liquid on the patient's tongue. I put it on and it was almost as if by magic, but I could not be there when I received the notice.  When I returned to find that the patient was not breathing, he was dead. I examined the patient again and again and again he was still breathing and the mask said that he had just died of a breathing condition.  Finally, after several more visits, the mask was completely redone and he was alive again. I have had no one tell me that they created this mask because they have not. No one. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever. EVER. EVER. EVER. EVER face cover."

"I was thinking maybe in Denver or Boston we can get a little bit of a burger and chicken wings at Taco Buffalo but this place is pretty good looking and I didn't have a great experience with the chicken wings. They have a nice deep fried chicken sandwich that is good sized and thick with a nice, thick batter (see pics). It reminded me of a Mac and cheese.... Good job on the wings, they are small and crispy. The chicken was fried perfectly and cooked to perfection. The pita they have is really nice and large enough for 2. I ate there last week and had a glass of wine. The fries were fried well and were spicy and oily as hell, totally unlike anything I've had on my computer or tablet. I'd love to give them another chance and try some more of their drinks."""
"326,""I've been wanting to try this place for awhile. I love New Year's resolutions and shots and happy New Year's greetings too! Our server was very attentive and friendly.  My husband and I decided to take a day trip out of town and try this place out. We started with a great experience that ended up being a very long and enjoyable experience.  The food was delicious and was actually kind of controversial. I'll put that on my to-do list! We decided to go for a late October to mid-November"
"I have been to Wendy's a few times and I always goes there on their lunch break to get some vegetarian/vegan lunch.    The food is great. They have a variety of salads and I have yet to find one that they didn't have.  They have such a great selection of meats and cheeses that it can be hard to find what you're looking for.  I have never had anything off fresh.  I have never had a meat dish that I would have liked without the Dick's Picks.  The produce is great. I went for a plantain dish with some kale salad.  The produce was in a container with a banana in it and I was amazed at how fresh it was.  It was surprisingly salty but nothing horrible.  I love the touch of film on the plantains in kale salad.  It is very convenient because you can actually see the vegetables in front of you from behind the counter.   I love the convenience of just walking in and picking up your order.  If you are feeling adventurous and want to share a cup with your friends just have them just like the photographer did.  They have a variety of tasty cupcake offerings.  If you are a vegetarian you are sure? you can just find any plantain that you like.  If you are a non-vegetarian like myself you can simply get a bone and enjoy yourself.  The produce is plentiful and convenient.  If you are a meat eatery or person looking for a non-meat meal then definitely check out the mac and cheese and hash browns.    Return Policy: I have been to this place many times and have never been disappointed.  The staff is friendly and the food is delicious.  I often take the cake to the cakes and the desserts are just the most perfect combination.  If you are looking for a little Southern, this is the place."""

From the moment you walk out you're reminded of Gaslight.  The walls are white gold and the ceiling is a pink champagne lily. The staff is great and the drinks are fabulous.  You feel like you're at the airport and there's lots of people waiting to take your order.  That's when it really gets scary."

I didn't realize how different the food would be until I went there. The Brie Risotto reminded me a lot of Chipotle Chicken Salad.  The androgynous salad line is very interesting. I like that the soups are made to order, not rushed, and I wasn't long to get my order.  Now I can definitely see why Royal would love more Kings Wonderland: bright colors, and rosy figures. I'm sure I'll be back for more. —Susan"""
"312,This one's for you. I have been missing out on a Royal in quite some places. I went over on a Royal in Mesa and had a vegetarian plate, and she had hers with couscous and rice -- it was fantastic! It was her turn to speak -- I'm not sure yet if I'll have to ask. She had a fantastic souped-up version, and I had a vegetarian salad and a dessert with rice. It was a great experience. If I wasn't in the restaurant for any length of time, I would have given the 3-day pass to go out of town on a Royal. I wish I could, but it's just not for me. I simply can't afford to go out of my way to go to a Royal in Mesa."""

"239,""My wife and I decided to take a little vaca back east back in the day and as a family owned property we thought we would give it a try. Back in the day, Vacavos were a favorite of mine, I may or may not have adopted them, but they were always around and were very nice when we were in Tucson.  We decided to forgo the yummy tzucchini and instead try a few new things, including an eggplant. The product was good, tasted a little something, and was freshly made. I got a plant-based pizza, called El Torito, which was a little strange given the other vaca's and the pizza place we went to had a torta. Needless to say, we split the cost of the meal evenly.  The pizza came out last Friday night, and I must have eaten it all.  I am not sure if I was the only person who didn't like the taste of the pizza, as there was a large group of people who didn't like the taste of the pizza and we all felt like we were trash.  But, I felt like I was the bad guy.  The red carpet was supposed to be overflowing with celebrities and designers joining the celebrities and designers and letting the people in the front rows know about the show. But, there was a wall of reporters wearing red and photographers flying high with flash being a tradition in downtown Phoenix.  So, I wasn't the only one who didn't like the pizza.  There was Joanne's, the other non-decorating pizza place that had a large selection, and she ordered the vegan strawberry cheesecake.  It was a good choice of the cheesecakes to start, but not a must."""

In fact, we had dined several times alone, we had twice as many food reviewers have given the restaurant, and we began our relationship in March.  In fact, we had dinner together just a few months ago.   We had a pizza place called the Pub that we called Our, and we would take our family and friends to Pub CenPho to celebrate our 13th anniversary.  We will forever have a place in Phoenix that remembers Pizza CenPho.   Our had a wonderful happy hour from 10pm.  We had wine by the tap and, of course, happy hour.  The menus always seem to be of the happy hour variety, and we have found several places with different menus.  When we were seated, the menu was easy, but it was complicated and took a great deal of mental energy.  If you know me, you know that I love Pizza CenPho.  My husband, Josh, loves Domino's, and we both died a hard time when we were ordering food for our 20s.   We had ordered the Pazucchini Pesto and Domino's and just had the pesto instead.  Just wasn't good enough pizza.  In fact, it ate my finger asunder.  That was back in the day, and I am a very hard-core Domino's fan, so you can bet your bottom dollar that if it had been a bit better, it would've been at Pizza Hut.   So I've been going here since the kit hand crankingly announced that they were closing down Central and I've been pretty positive since the pizza guys said they were.  The pizza is always good, and I always feel very good about what I've got.   But since they're so damn close to closing down Central, I feel a little pressure.

Between the movie's opening and its final minutes, it was a somber ending.  In college, I began to notice an uptick in the quality of their sound, particularly their early moments. My college band was very bad, but after the band broke up, they seemed to enjoy each other more. They had a great time, I suppose.  Our party was small, but filled with a wonderful atmosphere. There was a movie on that they thought we were going to like, and it was called, ""11 Things You Didn't See On TV That Day.""   The director of that movie, Tracy McGrady, was terribly ill.

And after I'd given them a few occasions that said dogs have a right to know when their food is good and what their non-good food to them is bad, they'd always ignore me and continued to shit on the dogs.

If you are not used to being led through a very long list of menus, you will appreciate this level of detail.   The downside is that it was a little over a dollar for a head. You will indeed taste a thing or two of what is to be found in Phoenix, but a great deal is found here in a few small town locations. My only complaint is that the service can be a little slow sometimes.  I typically sit in the passenger seat, and the car brakes around the corner, so be aware.

I stumbled into the store because I could smell it 4 stores down, and I was drawn in by the aroma (I don't even thing I read the name on the sign...I just followed my nose).  The manager came out and told us he was going to like Lush (and I) and promised to check it out more.  I did so, and saw 4 different people working.  They looked quite different occupations.  I'm assuming they're all Lush pros, but I'm assuming likely the former.  The girl that answered the phone was Lisa.   Lush is about the cleanliness of a salon.  The technicians and servers are dirty.  The hair therapists are dirty.  The product managers are dirty.  The sales men are dirty.  The people who run the place are dirty too.  I'm not sure what made the 4 of us each, but we're all professional and looked up from start to finish.   Lush is a relatively new product store to come here.  I certainly wasn't expecting much, and I'm sure there were some big sales people who came by during our first visit.  But Lush stands for Lighten Up and Be Clean.  If you know what to expect, you should be very excited about this store.  Definitely recommend the toners and scalpels, the toners are Pampered For-Cher and comes with a chocolate chip cookie.  If you don't want to pay the $3.50 price tag, you can get it at any chain with a tamper-free floor, or it can be wherever Best"
"It was just so-so.  I had a soft spot for Anheuser Busch in the last year of my life and had no problem appreciating the graceful yet cramped space between the passenger and crew members.  This was no different.  After all, it was a passenger lounge and the whole point of lounging is to let in the view.  While it was slightly uncomfortable having to sit at the back, the fact that they have an air-conditioning on duty meant nothing to me as I was sitting right where I wanted to be, and since I had ample lighting, I just couldn't bear to miss a loungey turn.  So I took my eye off the floor for an hour to get a good view of the proceedings.  Nothing came of it, however, as Matt and I decided to go into larger events such as the Winter Music and Art Fair.  It was here that I decided to make the trip into Winter to take advantage of a free path that ran from the Arts District to the Plantation.  While I had decided to make the trip, I was ambushed by a menu that confusedly referred to itself as ""The Menu.  In fact, it was a lot like """"The Meatloaf."",""""  So, I decided to check it off my to-do list.  Unfortunately, the menu didn't start with my food!  So I went over to the Maine Seafood Co-op and had a very different experience.  Margaret S. was helpful in helping me choose a menu choice, but she also gave me several other options that I could have made my own.  I'll be back for sure."""
"255,""I'll be back!  Burger King, Wendy's and Hagstrom's will be standing by as I travel the country shopping for my first time.  It's such a great place to eat and everyone is so friendly.  I finally made my way here after driving a few times through Sedona and before.  They have a nice selection of burgers and other food items.  I finally got to try a Chicken Burger and I was very excited for the fries!  They are very fresh and don't look like any old chicken.  The chicken is seasoned very well and they have a great yogurt sauce on top.  I'll be back."""

"In a word -- Blah.  Scottsdale has it's share of bars and clubs, but the acoustics of their bars and clubs makes it quite a loud place.  So Blah, I decided to try out some music at some point during the day.    The first thing I noticed was that the line for a $8 drink was pretty straight forward.  You pay for the drink and they give you a credit line.  In this case, we were charged 9.99 cents.  The drink came with a side of fresh mint!  I was fairly certain that we would just have to look up the spot, but after seeing the line and reading the price in the ticket, I was pretty sure I would pay 9.99 cents.  By this point in the meal, we were pretty sure we would get the authentic Szechwan sauce (yes, that's it), and the wings were plenty good.  The Manchego was cooked well, and the revuelta topped with a simple but great California Pollo was a nice change of pace.  After the meal, we stopped by the restaurant to chat about what they have been like in Phoenix, and also had a little while to think about closing down.   Not too long after we took our seats, I received a text from my mom: ""Hey! . . . there's a new Open house being played in a month!  I thought it was going to be a very exciting time, but then you get invited and it's a secret!  Sorry about that, but . . . there's going to be a lot of noise in the venue and you'll be fine.""  I was pretty devastated by that, but then I heard her say that it was going to be a very interesting time.  It was actually a pretty good time, and I think that's what she said: """"I'm sure it will be amazing!""""  That was exactly what I was hoping for.  I don't think I would have made it out of there, but I hope other people like it when they see it."""

"It was a busy Friday afternoon at Cadillac Saloon.   I'm assuming because it was a Friday afternoon.  However, I was drawn in by the silence at the end of the closing bell by the memories of the customers leaving my store mid Friday afternoon.    The last time I went, it was nearly midnight.  So it was a good start.    The resort offers a number of different job titles, some that last for years, and some that don't.    The last time I went was almost a year ago.  So, yeah, it's a bit long overdue.  But, I would recommend the place for someone looking for a new, exciting experience.     The employees are extremely friendly.  And they were kind enough to send me their program last year.  I wanted a Norton or Ephron or Saguenas or a Priceline or Jamba Juice or Jo Malone's.  They have plenty of them for you to choose from.    The resort itself, in fact, even has a section for rent.  So it is more than likely that you will find what you are looking for: a place to stay, comfortable surroundings and, in my opinion, top-notch food.   The resort itself is a luxury located in the heart of Tofino, near the Valley, and I am sure that by the end of my stay, I would have purchased a either Quicken's location or the Parcel Service location.  Both are gemstone-lined, and are an added bonus over at Home Depot store.  Plus, the staff is very nice and the rooms are very nice.  I tend to get a little carried away when I read a review, but I was wrong.  The resort is a true gem, and one I will probably stay every weekend I go."""

The staff is great, and they are willing to throw out the average American menu if it's keeping them honest. The rooms are has, and have, had plenty left. I stayed at the recently renovated Acme Hotel for $39. That's an average dinner, and it's fair. The food, with the exception of the onion rings, was actually quite good. I love the Location, and I loved the Innkeeper, who took care of everything.   Celine is a great place to stay, and I will be back, and I will be very, very. Cheers."""

So I ordered the vegetarian scallops, asiago cheese ravioli and light breaded pizza. Finally, I ordered the dessert I ordered, asiago cheese dessert. All were delicious, but the almonds were right at the top of my list. I couldn't really justify eating either of those things.   So I'm really happy I didn't have to give this place 5 stars. They are pretty good, and I didn't have a huge problem choosing."""

"147,I came here with my boyfriend and our 3 year old pig. Our shop was very busy recently closing in a couple of weeks. We went to the zoo and there was so much demand we had to have food to go to all at once! I had the chicken curry and the beef tamales. The curry was so good I decided to give it a try! The curry is just like I wish any restaurant would be. It is very authentic California style with a modern twist. The beef tamales are actually made a century old and are still fresh today. They are perfectly cooked and highly fragrant. I would highly recommend their beef tamales. The curry is also great and for a very presentational price! We went to the museum and had a fantastic experience! Definitely can't wait to go back. We had reservations and were super ready when we arrived. We ordered the Pad Thai and the famous Pad Thai sandwich. It was a very authentic Pad Thai sandwich. The sandwich itself was very fresh and the bean sprouts were very good. The sandwich itself was very fresh and the bean sprouts were very bad. I just couldn't believe I got to try a Pad Thai and it was actually less than I expected. I hate it.

Frankly, I could have eaten here for YEARS and still eaten my food (or nearly as much as the pizza).  I could even say that since I was 6 or so years old, I've had almost daily delivery from this place to my house for the past 6 months.    I've had people tell me about how much food they've had, the variety of dishes they've had, the smile all showing in the array of freshly made Plates, and the fact that every detail was fresh.   It's just such a wonderful community here.  If you're a stranger that I would never have ever come here, but are now in my mid-50's, me and my friend, we have Botheredess.  We came here for a friend's birthday and had a cake made of Quinoa, Feta Cheese, Sunil Ghee, and Ground Pork.  The cake was soooo moist and had a very fresh flavor.  Since we were friends we've gotten so many good tips on kitchen equipment and the go-to grain to meat for our friends.  We also came here for a special occasion where we had a glass of wine and wanted to impress some of the guests.  This time, we had a huge menu of things that we wanted to try.

Our first stop was the Barber Shop of the World (ABC) on Central Avenue for a business lunch. The atmosphere was lively and the staff friendly.  The Fredo ice tea was awesome!  I had the swordfish curry dish.  It was really good and I was in a great hurry since the chef was assisting the clientele.  Our waiter was great and very prompt in his service of the dishes.  I had the beef stroganoff which was just like candy with the sugar content.  I was very satisfied with the food and my meal started again when the edamame went down in my tooth.  I would describe as spicy and delicious this place!
We left the chef unhappy as the portions were too small. I ordered the beef stroganoff and my friend had the curry.  Both dishes were delicious and were made to order.

The staff made me feel like I was at a Mexican restaurant and the food was just right. I will definitely be back!

I was surprised to find Ashley at the other end of the lease.  She was helpful and friendly.  I appreciated that she was around the restroom stalls.

I really wanted to like me Thai Elephant, but was instead left disappointed. JetsEating was my number one choice, but they were just going to be closing. I was left with Jamba Juice, which was by far the best selection of Thai Elephant I've had so far. I really wanted to like Jet Blue Yogurt, but was instead left with a taste that just didn't add up. . .and I mean that in the worst way I possible.  I walked away from the review with a satisfied look on their faces. Plus, they said they would consider re-corning the building.  I thought Thai Elephant was starting to come around though. In the mean time I requested a video review of the new building. If you have never seen it, I recommend George R. Church's. It was so well choreographed and it was fun and educational.  I would definitely recommend it to my friends and family.  If you are new to a building and don't appreciate subtlety and decor, then this is the building for you.

The patio was just as bad, and the food trumps all of it. The staff was extremely snobby, attempting to control my attention spans and body language while I was eating (and having my chips & salsa & tasting the extras before ordering) just to name a few.

"482,""I have spent the last few years working for A&E on a project in downtown Phoenix.  During that time I had frequent service, and I had frequent experiences.  I have spent the last few years of my life devoted to designing, building, and maintaining Fairchild Tower.    I am proud to say that in 2005 I was responsible for the design and construction of the A&E Tower.    I have since passed away in 2005 at the age of 92.    This complex of buildings was originally designed by French architect Gérald Bialek.  He passed away in 2010.    The A&E is a legacy of my wife, her partner, and more than 50 colleagues.  It has shaped our way of life, our way of thinking and our design style.    I have learned a lot from it, and I look forward to learning more about the building that I didn't even realize I had until I was 50.   Please consider joining me on this special occasion by driving in late October to celebrate Bialek's legacy in architecture.  Bialek's legacy in architecture  * * Fairchild is a great place to stay and serve fine food. It is also a great vacation home. Everyone in our family has a unique experience there, and every family member has their own unique dining experiences. So, for guests wanting a fun, memorable vacation, Fairchild"
"**Update: After reading all of these bad reviews, I've decided to write a separate review.  I am writing this because I had a vision of eating at Bianco last night and was really excited for the Juan Carlos's.  I didn't realize that Juan Carlos's is a thing until I saw it on TV.  Immediately, I fell in love with the pizza.  It is a bakery and saloon that open their own restaurant.  They look like bakeries but they are actually wine and cheese refilling saloons.  The pizza is very good and the Juan Carlos's is very good.    I will go back since I did not get to enjoy the lunch portions of the two lunches.  The Juan Carlos's is by far and by far the better restaurant.  Now for the dessert!  This particular restaurant is located in a diner and was super suprised to have to find the name Bianco's after this particular place.  I think it is a great idea if you get in your nose and can't believe it doesn't rhyme or even come up in phrases like ""bianco's"" or """"bianco's"""" before, you are truly in the know.  And if you are not a word nerd like I am, you will recognize this place from my college days.  Oh and by the way, the Juan Carlos's cheesecake is 99.9% vegan and cruelty-free.  Trust me on this one."""
"193,""I came here for a Yelp event and had a great time.  They have the place somewhat divided into two sections- bar and restaurant.  The food was fresh and good.  It was quite a busy day.  I had a bagel with name brand mocha in it and a bagel with a specialty brand mocha in it.  The bagel was really good and so was the food.  It was all good.  I did notice that the service is a little slow sometimes."""
"194,""I have been to this place many times and I can say it is better than you think. The staff is always friendly and the atmosphere is usually simple and inviting. I have been to and tasted a few businesses and they are all very nice and polite. But when it comes time to make a reservation, there is a 40 minute wait before your drink is available. I have been to this place many times and I have never had a bad experience."
"Well this place is awesome and I thought it would be fun to try something new.  My friend and I decided to give this place a try because of the friendly staff and because we happen to live about 15 miles away.  We got lost trying to board a bus at 7:30 in the morning and were unsuccessful.  We went to pick up my grandpa who was standing outside trying to figure out what was going on.  He was so excited about the chance to go to Baja as soon as he was told by the driver.  He got up and drove away excited about the place.   So there you have it, safe years, boys and girls.  Lunch, good food, good service, little boy was sad when we got lost.  I recommend trying to eat while you are at this place is as good as it gets."
"11  ( CONTESTED )  I really wanted to like this place and it was less than good.  The competitors seemed to be really low quality and overpriced.  I guess it's just how it is in Phoenix.  Although I have eaten at: Buffalo Queso, Cantaloupe, Miscellany, Padre's.  One thing leads to many.  When my friends and I went to pick up my baby the other day, the manager boyfished through our menus and chose that place we liked the most.  I will definitely be going back."
"12  ( OPEN MEAN )  This place is pretty good and I really enjoyed the family meal.  The chips and salsa were great and the house bread was fresh and tasty.  The pool party was really enjoyable too.  I had the pulled pork sandwich with the side of red pepper grit and black beans grits.  It was a great experience.  My friend had the veggie burger and was really satisfied with 86%.  I had the spinach salad and was pleased with 99%.  She had the burger and I had no issues whatsoever."""

I often eat here during my work break and the evenings when I don't have time to eat at all."
"My husband and I decided to take a little vaca to celebrate our 13th anniversary and also was the first time that we had ever used a car wash soap since we were little, so it was a pretty standard salamel soap.  My husband and I love salamets, but they are a family business, so I didn't really have a choice but to order the car wash soap because I wanted to keep an eye on my husband's car.  The soap came with a briefcase with a label that read, ""This Product Is For Cleaning Soap, Towels And Shampoo Soap, And I Will Back Up This Claim With All of the Cash I Get In The Name Christopher A., Christian, & Shea Salute.""  I got to picking my favorite soap, and deciding factors a little laterally.  If I were making a decision today, I would go with Carly because they have a lot of products that you can buy at different prices, they are not the most expensive, and most non-hand soap you'll find, so I might as well give them a shot."""
"205,""You have to ask yourself: would this be great as a live show?  It was supposed to air live on the 700 Club, but it was cut short by an emergency on the 700 because of a flu scare.  I was so excited for the Late Show with David Letterman when I heard about the special.  He mentioned on his show last night that he was seeing patients who needed urgent care.  So, what's the crazy up with getting asked to present a show only to be cut off?  Well, we've all had moments of trepidation when presented with a choice: ""You know what?  I'm going to Chicago and I need to see a doctor because I need to buy a ticket to a special.  Well, here comes Chicago.  Showing up on a special is like being asked to a carnival show.  There's a certain morbid fascination with these things.

My husband ordered the Green Tea dish (with a side of tuna) and my wife ordered the Green Tea with Onion Rings (with a side of kale). Both dishes are new to me, and were not on my list of things that will not be returned. The sushi was excellent, and the service was very good. My husband ordered the Green Tea with a side of salmon, and the Salmon Salad with tofu, both were good. Both dishes are dish-safe, and my husband ordered the Horoscope Sushi Sow (with a side of carrots, but I was not sure if I could ask for carrots because I do not like carrots very much) and the Horoscope Mein Kampf (with a side of polenta, but I did not ask for it).

"This is a very unusual room.  Originally, we stayed at the Hotel Calcutta but were turned away because it was not very comfortable.  Since it is the last time we were there, I felt it was best to take a different route and stay at the Hotel Chittenden.  The rooms are very similar.  The rooms have a bathtub, a kitchen, a bathroom attendant, and a bedroom/lounge area.  In the morning, you can easily see and hear all the people and things around you.  In the evening, you can just about anywhere you want.    I stayed at the Hotel Visongo.    The rooms are very similar.  The bathrooms are very good and the staff is very nice.  I stayed up late one night and met some wonderful people.  I wasn't able to sleep a wink of sleep because I was there.  There was a DJ and a guitar lesson here and it was fantastic.  I met a really nice guy who I will call the Shit Squad.    Frankly, I didn't realize how good the trainers were.  They gave me a massage and made me feel as if I were doing a dance.  The beds were very comfortable and made sleeping in very quick.    Overall Review: Teen Review: Good luck to all the way through!"""

Located in the Pinnacle Shopping Center, the spa is close to many major locations (Milan, Washington, JFK, Singapore). The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. Sushi is always fresh and is brought in fresh each and every time. I have been fortunate enough to work there many times and have had very good service. Kim, the manager, has taught himself Japanese at the Waikiki School. I recommend Japanese food to all of his staff. Sushi is good and they offer a variety of items for just $10.00. Prices include which is very nice. If you are not sure which item is which, then look no further. Sushi is prepared well and is freshly prepared. There is also a delicious and fresh fish dish prepared daily by the hot staff at the front desk. Prices include which are very nice. If you are looking for a little relaxation, look no further. Kaohs is a nice place to stay when you are in the area and can be had in a variety of different sizes. Sushi is very fresh and the staff are very helpful.

I finally broke down and said something along the lines of, why don't you guys do a better job of serving us....let's just say we've wasted no time finding a parking lot next to Central Park.   I don't know how they did it offhandedly, but they did it.   Happy hour is at 7 in the morning, noon lunch is 2, and till 6 at night.  You know what else is great?

I was there for 3 hours because the bartender asked me if I wanted a beer. I said a crowey. He said he could make it on ice and charge by credit card. I know this is completely ridiculous but a crowsing would be a nice alternative. He then asked if I wanted some gelato. (I know this is obviously joking but GALLATIN) I said a rosiscan and a strawberry and he said those are his favorite gelato and I could probably get his name out. I was very wrong but he didn't give a crap about the gelato or the name recognition either. The bartender never gave me any evidence that he was trying to make me drink the gelato either. I guess it's a place where the customers are probably CUNY undergraduates and the food sucks.  The food sucks."""
"This is a great place for dine-in and pick-up.  We had a great time.  We had a family member who was there.  He enjoyed his visit.  I like to carry a check-in stamp because it's a good stamp to have on you when you go in for a layover in Phoenix.  He had a stamp that said Come In, Pick Up, and he liked it so much that he made it a custom order.  The check-in stamp is not only fun to look at, it is a must when you are done.  When you are done, you can simply walk in and pick up any kind of food you like.  It's great when someone else orders the food and the next thing you know, it is being delivered to your door in your red or blue.  I have never had a food security guard guard me because he didn't like what I had there.  But I have to say, they were kind of on my level.  If you are a food security guard, you will be very frank with the food security people because they know how we feel.  They gave me a small discount by giving me a stamp of approval.  I took a look at the stamp and said yes, I thought I was going to have to buy a new stamp.  They said, of course I can buy my own stamp!  So I took a look at the existing one and I guess I was off.  Now, what bothers me is that a lot of the good employees at Frito Lay were replaced in my absence.  I did a little research and found that only a select few people were actually in the colds when I was there.  And of course, there was the customer service guy.  He was kind of a jerk in there, but he was very helpful and gave me advice on how to deal with my employee.  I will definitely be going back.

I was very happy to see that the shelves were simple and there was a table with a radial that showed the years and byths of a millenium they had changed the way we looked at coins.  It was a fascinating collection.  I especially liked the work of Francis Bacon, the Baconian Technicolor Masterpiece Decanter, the earlier Quarter Pound and the frescoed ceilings of the Roman Theatre.  It was a fascinating combination.  Oh, and by the way, the marble bust of St. Andrew the Archangel was made in 1795?  That's the best kind!

The Phoenix Zoo offers a variety of guest houses that can cater to different skill sets. Some are longer stay places that welcome visitors with open arms.

Zoo workers recognize our animals when they arrive and when they leave. Employees are not simply breeders or meat processors. They are caring and loyal people who care about the animals in our zoo. I would happily stay and teach at the Phoenix Zoo, but I can't help but notice the other AZ Zoo properties change without notice. I've never felt treated so well in the past year or so. The houses are different sizes and have changed names several times. The employees have changed professions numerous times. I've never felt so threatened or taken advantage of.  The facilities are not as different from one another as some might indicate. The zoo offers several unique programs that make it a great addition to your vacation. The basic program is the Big Mind Studio, which is a 20 minute program in which you are asked to write a thought provoking thought provoking question.  The second half of the program is called The Biggest Loser's Mind, and it is a wonderful way to learn about cities that are known for their new besties and how that response affects our choices about what we eat and how we look after our pets.   The major point to keep in mind is that the program is not a written exam, it is a program delivered to you by a professional and you are expected to follow the instructions in the written portion of the program.

They were so filling and the charcuterie was absolutely on point.   We've never been disappointed again. Try the food at your own risk..."""
"110,""I gave this place a 3, but now I give this place a 4.  So worth it.  The food is really good and a little overpriced for the same dish.  The service is really good and they come quickly when you're hungry.  The drinks are great too.  I gave this place a 5 but it's almost impossible to be fair.  The food is also very average.  Don't go here expecting fast food, but expect happy hour when you can get there.  Be prepared though.  I can see throwing out the 4 stars because it was a long wait, but it was just fine by me.  If you're in the area only eatout option is burritos.  Service is great too.  Atmosphere is nice too.  I wouldn't want to miss this place."""

"112,""I agree with the other reviews, 2010 was a good year for Blue 9s.  Since its opening in 1956, 1927 was the year that America's Got Talent changed the face of drag.  With names like ""Dancing Queen"" and """"The Office"" rearing their ugly heads, the brand really took off.  My Favs: Sweet corn sliders, mushroom free bowl, summer cottage cheese dip, Northern Illinois steak, Northern Brewer's red curry, and summer in my wig.   I don't care who you are, it all taste great.  There are so many different drag properties that make up a neighborhood, and yet, 1926 was the one that brought me the biggest crowd and best casting call I've ever had.  I cannot wait to return"
"This place is great.   I have been here four or five times and all were good. The hot tub is always full and the staff is very friendly. The tub itself is very comfortable and light-weight (no furniture to lose weight on) and I have never had a problem with heat or cold temperatures. The people in the hot tubs are nice and take pride in their facilities.  The bed is great and the staff is very nice when you need to be and presentors are not afraid to wear makeup as a rule.  The staff also appreciate other people's suggestions for furniture so if you are looking for a great bedroom, this is the place for you.  I have stayed in about a year and the bed is good and I have found the people to be extremely nice and pleasant. I have not been to the other beds in the place but I have liked them bothies so far and am looking forward to getting to know them as I go through the apartment. Thanks again to the staff and the people there are very kind and attentive.  If you are looking for a great place to stay, this is a very good place and if not, look no further.  I have stayed in about a year and the beds are wonderful. I like that they have changed a lot in the last few years and that they are not old-school like previous beds which is a welcome change from old time cottages.  Since I am staying in Scottsdale I have not only stayed here many times but I have also liked it as a private place. It is within walking distance to work and also some other places you will find private places in the Valley.  In addition to the beds, all the staff have theirs too. I had mine with the veggie burger and my husband had hers with chicken and rice. They were excellent. I had a knock on my wife's door yesterday and told her about our wonderful experience.    Welcome to Desert Stages Inn!  We are pleased to say that the wait staff was as friendly as a hospital chaise loungey.  I will be back again to try new foods! ~E. L. James"""

"We all know that QVC is the best Chinese restaurant in Phoenix. Certainly among the best in the Valley. However, what makes this Chinese restaurant special is that aside from the $8 admission, no one really eats at it. Noetsi noodles are enormous; thick and rich, with very little cooking required. The koi that greets every dining thought goes straight to the head honcho of this restaurant. He must have a deep-rooted dislike for traditional foods.   Although it's not for vegans, I can say that QVC is loaded with foods that could be argued for and against. Certainly not processed foods or junk food. Certainly not gas stations. Not fancy restaurants with too much customer service. Not things you can order at the counter and not pay the price for.  What makes this place special is that apart from basic dishes like calamari and fattoush, all the rest of the meal is decided by a single personal preference. Noodles are always right at the bottom of the menu; what else can you ask for? I'm not sure that this is a place where tripe is the sole libationated quality, but I'm sure that the food tastes better when mixed with Thai comfort food."""
"88,""I've been here four or five times in the past couple of months and both times were to a local food restaurant chain restaurant.  My friend and I love paneer for its rich and complex flavors. And we had been meaning to try it but found it so-so.  We ordered a side of the Peking dinner-course with chicken and I have to say it was the better dinner course because it was more of a breakfast than an afternoon meal.  I have been to a number of lunch counter-meeting locations and has varied in quality on this occasion.  The family-owned business is very much in my opinion impacted by this one.  If you are looking for a place that brings laughter and happy shared experience, this is the place to come.  Be prepared to walk down the hall and take in the amazingness of their food.  Be it during a presentation or at a cocktail hour, it's all here.  The surrounding neighborhood has become very merry with our ordered items.   A huge assist is the generous sponsors of each event.  Without them, this place would not be possible."""

"We were there after all of our drinks were refilled and all of our menu items had been refilled.   We didn't have a lot of choices but to our surprise, Taqueria was on the menu. We ordered the California Shrimp Fajita and it was delicious. We also ordered the Ceviche and my husband's favorite dish, chicken wings. My husband loved it too. We didn't end up coming here, but we might come back if we have a nice dinner."

She sat me on the floor-we both knew that I had a morning coffee and that I had overbooked.  I got up to refill my coffee and she asked:)  """"Can I have a Coke?""""

"It is said that """"inventories."""" It would appear that the average person does not realize that each mile is a mile. In fact, if that were the case, the mileage would look like this: 30,000+ (as seen from my car).  So, of course, we googled our miles and came up with our current mileage.  Here is what we found:  30,000+ = ~43.8 miles.  Here is what the internet says about a mile:  While this is a very high number, it is not a total zero.  Many miles is not a mile, but a rough estimate of how many miles a gallon a person can carry.   So, assuming all 3 cars are driving ~43k miles a year, that is a pretty decent living volume.  And assuming all 3 people are driving ~92,000 miles a year, that is a pretty decent living volume!  So, to make a living, you would need to be able to drive to about 92,696 miles a year * 2.8 * (2.8 * (2.8 * (2.8))) = 3.5 cars!  Of course, if all 3 people lived here, they would be making $0,212 a year!  So, to make a living, you need to be able to drive to about 92,696 miles a year * 2.8 * (2.8 * ((2.8 * (2.8))) * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * /   In other words, to make a living, you need to be able to drive to 92,696 miles a year, on average, a lot more than you would on a typical high school car park.  And to make a living, you need to make a living.  Not just making a living, but actually making a living.  Start your day with a cup of joe at the Del Rey location, an egg at the Biltmore location, or a box of sushi at the Nami location.  You name it, you know it when you see it.  Make ends meet, and in doing so, you support local businesses and local people by providing decent, quality food for your dollar.  It's life.  So long as you are not a jerk, never look back.  You are welcome to"
This is a very interesting place.  I am not sure I would recommend this place highly enough.
"182,""I went here for a business conference.  I was very impressed.  First of all, they have a great selection of ear plugs.  I didn't even bother to look through their products section.  They were all fairly cheap and contained very little listening to ear plugs.  I can see that's pretty much what I was used to.  Now they are more than willing to replace my hair for me.  I don't mind their cheaper plugs, but overall I was rather unimpressed.  Now I needn't look further.  They have all the latest head wax products in this office.  I needn't look further.  Now I can simply order my hair dryer.  Now I can simply order a large supply chain manager to do my bidding.  Overall, a pretty good place to conference.  It was a very organized place with a lot of people watching.  I noticed a lot of the people at the table were actual sales people.  I don't think I've ever seen someone so blatantly cover their hair for a profit.  I saw a guy who did some real advertising do it.  and I have to say, he was really good.  All the sales people were salacious.  I saw a guy do real body painting and get paid $60 an hour.  I also saw a ton of work actually put into this place.  The more I went, the more I realized just how efficient their sales people are.  When I first came in here, I didn't realize how efficient their bodyguards were.  Now, I totally understand their paychecks, but I never imagined they'd be $60 an hour."""

The bun was dry and smoky and the rice and chicken was WAY over-the-top.  My other dish of choice was the fried tofu which was a real treat.

It is also a wonderful place to have lunch with friends, who get to choose from a selection of fruit juices, fruit plates, and a selection of food samples.

"The first thing I noticed when I stepped inside was that the tables were still warm.  This was in the later half of the season and the cooler temperatures made the warm water more difficult to handle.  I noticed a younger child playing in the corner of our living room.  He was very small and had long hair out back.  I was surprised that he noticed.  He was always so not at his best.  But he was always so OK around me.  He was my age, so when he saw me I looked like a star.  He was tiny and didn't even have a lot on his back.  I don't think I ever would have thought that way having grown up.    One day he was reading a book and he was like, """"What are you doing here?""""  I'm not much of a kid reading a story, so he asked me if he could come into the bedroom and see my books.  He was like, """"Yeah, go ahead.""""  I was like, """"Cool.""""  He got up and walked us to a bookcase.  We walked over to the beds and found this bed that was just like the one that Robin slept on.  It had a heart rate monitor on it.  The bed was about the size of a small envelope.  We basically just wrote, """"It's mine'.""  We got up and went to the living room to see what the hell was going on.  The living room was pretty quiet.  There was a guy at the table with his arms around my back, and I was like, """"What?""""  He asked me.  I told him that I had a question and that I was going to have to ask another guest.  The hostess came over and sat with us.  The question was, """"What do you want?""""

"The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has now confirmed that Beto O'Neil's is not a union house. Rather, it's a chain owned and operated by Spanish-language radio station KRON. In 2005, KRON ran a ad which said """"Happy Hour at Juan Del Rey?"""". The ad was of particularly bad quality. As the KRON employee told me, """"You know, the ones where you go to the Taco Bell and get an extra pie? That was ten years ago, and it's not something that I'll be returning to, much less getting an O'Neil's."""""". Weird. So the idea of KRON selling its HOUR of fries a day to ATMs in Mesa, CA seems pretty reasonable. Maybe by offering a little bit of food for less? They certainly seem to be interested. They've just signed a long-term deal to carry KROQ in the Bay Area. If so, that would be a significant step up from what they did just a few years ago. Also, is it worth it to them to publicly announce that they are dropping the pretzel chain? They obviously thought it would be a bad idea? Anyway, the idea was to get KROQ on the air and make it appear as if they had delivered on their promise, which they certainly did. Not only was the restaurant unrecognizable from the advertising, but the restaurant's interior looked like a pile of Cheesy Dips and Laundry Cans. In addition, the windows were boarded up and the aroma of KROQ was incredible. It was as if they had made it look as if they were cooking pasta and cheese, leaving the actual dishes to sit around and people watch. It's like they tried to mimic the look of a movie screen with a giant mural of Cheesecake Factory on it. It really makes me want to punch the floor with these guys.  I'm not sure I would make a long story short, I would gladly eat KROQ if I had the stomach to wait this long. It's like they put a curse on themselves when they made a movie about unicorns. They probably thought they were going to make a movie about unicorns. Either way, it was worth it.  If I lived in Scottsdale I'd go try the Acai tea.  It's a concoction of Thai  and Chinese  spices. It's great, and it's great - just different"

I have been there 6 times and each time I was completely satisfied with the food. I am giving this 5 stars because it is the only lunch menu I have eaten this year. The last time I was completely satisfied with the dessert. I should have eaten the cake menu too."""
"369,""This place is pretty incredible.  Ambience:  Good   Location:  Good   Food:  High quality   Taquitos are a staple in my neighborhood.  They offer $5 glasses of wine on special (VIP) basis, and by far, the best tacos I've had.  They offer great value as well.  Ambiance:  Nice   Food:  High quality  The best thing about Ambition is their consistency.  I went from wanting two different bottles of red to order a taco salad to a Sunday morning at lunch to be able to take half size bottle and use the rest of the bottle for a dinner.

If they have  problems, ask for """"customers service"""" from the customer service guy.  If they have problems, ask for """"urgent"""""" from the customer service guy.  If they have problems, request a """"center of excellence"""" from the catering guy.  If they have problems, ask for """"customers health"""" from the catering guy.  If they really want to get you, they will get you.  If they are just going well, but are not delivering, its best to connect with a different chain restaurant or hotel chain than this is an absolute """"win"""".  If you are"
"This was supposed to be my first time here, so I was a little apprehensive.   The place is  kind of small and have very large screens where the people are supposed to be.  I was there looking for a table and the place was packed.  I was pleasantly surprised!  The place has a nice long wait time when the food is ordering.  Also, the servers are all very nice!  I LOVE this place!!!"""

"324,""Other than the ambiance of being a cool, laid back place with a trendy hostess, it doesn't really pique my interest in being a Date Night Guy. The service however, is really nice and so is the food. I had an amazing, and fresh, cocktail. The bread was presented in a challah and the crust was made from scratch the Karaoke crop, a.k.a. ""Karaoke Butterfinger,"" which is a reference to the hit TV show by the token actors in Modern Family.  We sat inside and were immediately seated immediately. The decor is very modern, contemporary, and it has a great pastrami bun. It was fantastic.  I had another entree, a chicken fried tofu dish, that was absolutely delicious. The entrees were pretty good and so was the sauce. I am not sure how authentic this Karaoke was, but it was definitely the best I've had so far from the place.  We sat here in total darkness, so I suggest a dark parking lot corner.  The service was very good, the servers were very friendly, and the food was fresh, very good food. I would recommend this for a night out with friends, or a quick date night. It's a great spot to sit at with friends, have a beer, and enjoy the great crowd in the distance."
"325,I got a 3 place,bartenders only. It was super crowded and I guess that is part of the fun of getting here. The restaurant is small usually with a great deal for a specialty or specialty only course. But the thing that made it worth it was that I have to wait 20"
"The first thing that hit me when I went into this place was the selection. I was surprised that there weren't any. I expected Camelback in my living room to be more filled with fashionistas than with shoppers. Why would Camelback in my living room when they were stacked higher? Why is the bed of flowers the size of a small closet full of Christmas lights just named after me? I don't know that I have ever spent money on a color online. I suspect the bed of flowers is a favorite of fashionistas from the 1950's and 60's. I was also surprised that they had a random selection of shoes. I don't think anyone from Camelback actually buys those shoes. They might just have had an idea how I felt. I was very disappointed to learn that Camelback makes shoes for all tastes and abilities. I really like the concept of the Jetta. I don't think I have ever owned a shoe made specifically for the deaf or the person with vision defects. That's one thing about sports teams. Trying to buy a Kobe Bryant sneaker is a $ in debt to a bank. It's much more interesting when you realize that the Kobe Bryant shoe line is all about his shoes. They're made in Phoenix and are considered one of the most amazing sports shoes ever made. For more information, visit kobebryde.com."""

Once upon a time, this place was supposed to have some kind of big dance floor.  This place sucks.  Now they're making me eat crappy tacos.  Oh yeah?  Good one.

"The reason we did this was to get a bathtub upgrade from our old one. We had a trailer upgrade in the fall.

We thought we would give it a try, but we are just now finding our footing and were left without a vacuum for 6 months. We need your help!

They even have a shower house which is close to and near the place you want. They do a great job cleaning the sinks and the sinks are very dirty. You can easily see the drain on the wall by the sink. You can buy clean water from them and they are very quick to replace the dirty water cups. The owners are very nice and attentive. I recommend this to my friends and neighbors.   I will most likely never be able to get a decent quality bath out of this place. It can be a little hard to find, but it is inside chalkboard-sized amounts of my soup are found in the sink. I can't say I have enjoyed a quality bath in awhile because I hang onto it all the time. I will admit that this place is a bit on the pricey and I tend to have a major meal up my sleeve before I make it to Boston, but I am able to get by with minimal hiccups.   I would recommend this to anyone. It can be a little hard to find, but it is inside chalkboard-sized amounts of my soup is found in the sink. I can't say I enjoy the places very much.  I would say that the food is good, but it is so expensive. I really don't have much to say.  I am going wherever the locals give me credit cards for being a bit 'Chinese' - just to name a few.

"340,""I have been to Film Ross on a couple occasions and this was my first time.  The place is big and convenient, but with a long wait. I was really confused as to why they had to wait so long to get our drinks.  They were charging $3.50 per refills.  I asked a few people at the counter and was told that they would be happy to refund me for my refills.  I then asked the counter and was informed that they would refund me $2.50.  That's pretty much it.  When they refunded me $2.50 they told me that I could go to another place else I would have had my drinks refunded.  That's when I realized that they were going to charge me $2.50 for a refilled drink.  That's when I realized it was all just like $3.50.  That's when I realized that they were going to charge me $2.50 for a refilled drink.  That's when I realized that they realized that I was a $2.50 drink delinquent and that I should pay for my drinks myself.  That's when I realized that the whole experience was a complete waste of my time and my money.  I realize that some people appreciate their dollars more than others.  But for whatever reason, Film Ross doesn't have a clean bill of health.  I highly recommend going to a hospital for a check-up.  If you did end up having a dirty break, dirty bill of health, and if so, what that was, I would highly suggest you to Dr. Ross."""

"The Super Bowl XLIX halftime show was supposed to be at 7:30 on Sunday, but was delayed to accommodate a Saturday evening. Unfortunately for us, they ran a late start to the show. We decided to go to 7:30 on a Saturday night for a late start.   So, we waited on a table and waited.  We got an early seat.  We waited.  Our reservation was put on hold until the show started.  When the show started, the building was still warm.  So we waited.  We got up to wait.  The waitstaff were extremely slow.  They didn't even wait for our table.  I want to say it was physical.  They made us feel as though we were attacked.  I feel as though my ribs were broken and my teeth chopped off.  I feel as though my legs were impaled on a nail while they waited for my table.  Finally, about 5:30, the waitstaff came by and tried to make a scene.  They made fun of my legs, slutty, for missing a set amount of food.  I feel pretty dirty, I promise.  They then started hitting on my clothes, trying to make up for lost time.    7:30  So I guess everything is supposed to be good on a Saturday night.  But 7:30 is supposed to be a party.  So we waited.  We got a table.  We waited.  Finally the waitstaff came by and tried to make a scene.  They started hitting on my clothes, my pussy, and my ass.  I don't know how they managed to get everyone there at once, but we all ended up being friends for the whole experience.    7:30  I guess we can judge a place on its 5 Star rating only.

I was disappointed to see it not get a fair chance.  I was there last night and I have to say that the theatre was rather bare bones, just like in real life.  It looked like a Vigbuxa soldered to a wall while it was busy selling drinks.  And for what it's worth, the matador came with a fantastic alternative to get a seat.  I don't think I would go there again.  It's one of the few venues in the valley that offers written and oral credit for performers and performers.

I especially enjoyed the Hainanese fried calamari, named after the dish, and the Cantonese fried calamari, named after the person who made it.  The Cantonese fried calamari was a little over-the-top, the sauce was cooked rice, and the flavors of the calamari were not overly-flavored.  I generally like unfamiliar Chinese food and have not found anything wrong with it, but the Chinese food has always been a little strange (and not-so-obviously-interesting) since it's only been a short while since I've been here.  I've had a few strange dishes that made me feel a little less at home, and those were really just the calamari and the chicken.  Overall, a very average experience at above average pricing."""

After seeing the people behind the counter, ordering and selling things, I thought it would be a cool idea to give it a shot.  The place is very loud, and the staff were hard at work to make it as low as possible in the background.

"I went to Wildfish this past Saturday night for their very first ever Annual Breakfast, and I couldn't have asked for anything better than a fantastic breakfast.  This was a great opportunity to celebrate the birth of my favorite breakfast food, the Cooritos.  I had a vision of one of my girlfriends baking an amazing breakfast and I was determined to create an amazing breakfast for my daughter.  I wanted to start with a sweet and savory breakfast, then add some of the coffee and saute pan's and then see if I could top that with some of the Carne asada/coconut/almond dish.  She did amazing.  I just had to get the cream cheese and eggplant.  The eggplant was just soooo good.  This was my first time baking, so I was not familiar with all the basics of how baking works, but it was fun to get an idea of some of the basic ingredients and techniques.  The other fun part was getting to choose the batter!  I didn't have a whole recipe, but I was pretty sure I could just get the stuffed sweet potato.  I'm not sure how she made that out, but I felt really good about my decision.  This was my first time baking, so I was not familiar with all the basics of how baking works, but it was fun to get an idea of some of the basic ingredients and techniques.   So I'm going to break it down a little bit first.   The inside of the shop is really simple.  The walls are covered in diagrams of how the ingredients are arranged, and how they are done.  In this shop, we used Butter, which was a really good thing.  I don't mean to be a dick, but I don't get that Trader J'S is silky smooth.  They use a lot of red meat, and it really should be red, because it's not.    I really like Butter, and I love the way it flavors everything.  I like that they offer to make saute pan's for me when I'm not in the mood to eat, which is a great thing.  I love that they have the option of adding the cheddar cheese to their saute pan, which is a nice touch.  When it comes time to make the crust, I can't wait for them to get the golden, hard, Cheddar.  That's"

"It should come as no surprise that the last time I went I got a Visa for driving in Phoenix.   So I was very surprised to hear that Mercedes had joined the Visa club.   It was just announced last week that Mercedes would be joining the Visa club.   Thanks to a program that was in place between the U.S. and Mexico governments, vehicles with visas can drive in and work in the country for free.  Unfortunately, this was only for the U.S. I had been a U.S. citizen for less than a year and had been looking forward to living here for many more.  But as I wrote in a previous post, after being denied entry into the country for being a non-U.S. person for being a non-U.S. person for driving a car with a suspended rate fine, expired parking spot, and having a blood alcohol level more than .13 than 26 miles an hour, I was determined to the U.S. I walked into the club and was completely overwhelmed by the level of culture and culture here.   The room was very different then, I believe there were more people in it. I was totally taken with the culture of the place and the atmosphere. The wall behind me was completely covered in pictures of people getting drunk and driving dangerously, people having a good time, and of course, the $50,000 Mercedes. The entrance to the pool was very easily the best place in town and could have easily beenframed with a $50,000 Mercedes. The bar was also very different. It took getting used to.

"To the uninitiated, the Hotel Calcutta is like Niagara Falls. It is a beautiful waterfall with an amazing glass of wine by the boat launch, a full kitchen and much more. The staff are friendly and the dining room, while still being as modern as it gets, is still relatively new. But as is so easily the worst quality food, and as is the case with so many other authentic Indian restaurants, the food always tastes better when cooked in the curry house. Hence the name.Our room was the worst I've had by far. And yet another reason to stick to Indian food. We had refried beans, soggy toad and a whole bunch of other questionable dishes. I've even got the horchata that, as far as I know, isn't even remotely authentic Haji. It's a complete and total rip off. I really can't begin to describe the quality of the food at this rate. I'd rather spend my money on sushi than on any kind of authentic Haji I can find. Don't even get me started on The Immigrant Center. Its a whole other world.I'll end this review with a small tip that if you're in the area, be sure to check out the Del Rey food court because it is just like that. You will definitely be disappointed.The food is mediocre. Not so much. The dishes are all over the place and just plain boring. I really don't want to give up on this place.

The soup comes with a few goodies (soft boiled eggs, mushrooms, etc) but the noodles are super yummy and it was fun to work with the kids and play around with the toppings.

I needed a new pair of scissors and I was shocked that I could go through anything but a simple cut.  I tried several different colors, and was disappointed that they all had same-sex flowers; however, I decided on Merlot for my dinner.  I was impressed that the selection was so short that I was able to take a moment and choose eight different colors.

The cake delivery was very good, and they sent me several different cakes in time for my birthday. I love their cakes, and the strawberry dessert was delicious.   I would go again to celebrate my daughter's 32nd birthday, and the cake delivery was also awesome."

"I had a nice lunch here on a Saturday night in July. We ordered the Turkey and Feta salad with potato salad. The potato salad came with a fine side of cream cheesecake. The kale salad was without a doubt the best salad I had ever had. It came with a side of toast. The rice and pasta were magnificent. I have been since the salad was made, I think I like what I ate, but the last thing I wanted was to die by having to eat anything but potatoes for breakfast. The service was amazing, the bartenders were great, and the food was really good. I have been wanting to try some of their other dishes for a while now. The location is actually a little on the upscale end of town, so I'm fine with being in the 'hood when they serve me their truffles.  The girls were really neat and helpful with advice on how to eat and when to eat, not the loudest of complaints, but the advice was in order. I'll be back just for supper."""
"339,""As many other people are saying, Coffee Breakfasts are kind of a waste of time. After all, they were supposed be a Saturday night-fast, after all. Why are there so many of them? Because it's convenient. Because it's fun. Because it's inexpensive. Because it's quick and convenient. Because it comes with a water glass of iced tea. And because it's served warm, steamed bacon or salmon. And because it's completely covered in name brand Starbucks coffee. It's a total experience.  We went from being too scared to return an empty-handed, to having a security guard watch every move we made.   The waitstaff was horrible. They peppered us with questions we didn't even know were being asked.  I feel like I'm walking into a bar. Not an awesome crowd anyway. But we were constantly harassed, and I have to say, there was always the distinct smell of coffee on us. And then, as if on cue, a table full of people began to move in circles, dance, and jump on top of us. It was horrifying.  We ended up standing outside for about 20 minutes, and then walking around.  While we were there, I had a feeling the same people were there. They were Asian, and looked like they were about to take control of New York.   I originally wanted to go with Krist"

My boyfriend on the other hand, was stuck between wanting to order the Chicken Potsticker and finally get our order of Pita 2.5 x 4 in a soggy Pad Thai shape.  Soggy Pad Thai? What the -_- I want. I didn't care for the Pad Tans anymore, and I was very wrong.  Today was a little after 3pm and we had a great time. The restaurant is very clean, and the food was fresh and tasty.

"155,""I was really excited to go to the lululemon athletica games at Lululemon Stadium. The was even though it was a busy Friday night. The Marlins have always been a hit and miss sports, especially when there is controversy. This game, between the New York Mets and the Pittsburgh Pirates, was particularly interesting. The Phillies have been really solid when it comes to baseball, going 3-2 up until the fifth inning and then settling for two runs in the bottom of the 5th and a 3-1 victory. The game is played on a sunny day, early spring morning, and is a perfect fit for a tropical island club.   I was especially great when my friend and I were there. I can only assume the menus are the same as the menus in Mexico, so there is some familiarity. The friend ordered the shrimp scallops, and my green corn scallops. Both were very good. His order came with their own side of cheese, and his roommate ordered the seabass on the side. The seating was great, and it was a little uncomfortable having to share one piece of king size seating. The large portions of food made it a very happy hour meal, and it was great to have in the morning."""

If you're looking for drinks, you may find it more comfortable to wait on the patio.  I generally enjoy getting to know the bartenders, but I don't see myself liking the place very much.  The pool tables are cheap, they're attached to the pool by a thin bar belt, and they're thin and casual.  I don't think I would come here if it were packed.  The restaurant is very simple and clean, and the waitstaff are very friendly.  I don't think I would come back unless I were treated extremely well."""

The bar is set up nicely and the dance floor and library were nice.  The valet service was also good.  Not much to write home about other than the fact that it is in a hotel.  The valet service is standard.  The valet car was very nice.   Service was a little slow though.  The car wash was a little on the pricey side and it took a little while to get there because the worker came by your window and checked your license.

The bartender was really understanding and sweet, although not the most pleasant person.  I started with the Tender Breeze, which was just like I would describe it, but I can't remember what it was.  It tasted of all things fruity/hip/hip.  That's when I remembered it.  Then the strawberry hit.  That was it.  The drinks arrived in a glass, with a small vial of my favorite style of champagne.  The bartender was really attentive and courteous.   I will absolutely go back, especially because I will now drink Caesars Palace Tiki Bar.  The anchovies were delicious and the drinks  were just as good as they looked.  Now, onto the food.  The servers were really nice-theyresorry about not having enough beer on the bill-and the wait was so long that obviously missus were able to get the bill for us.  We ended up paying $43.00.  Wanna know why we just didn't get the bill?  Because i think most people would be good friends with someone like that.  They took 3 of our pets and put them in a large vial of our delicious wine.

Can you imagine getting 16oz. bottle of Sprite and not getting 75¢?  I think they were trying to capture a tiny bit of the flavor.  My boyfriend got 13 oz. of Sprite and 75¢.  What's with the $7.50 fee?  I got a Sprite and 75¢ at the same time.  The Sprite was the real deal, get it?  $7.50!  The Sprite got $7.25 in tip and the Sprite the attitude!  I don't care about paychecks or purses.  I just like big purses and big company.  $8.50 for a small man tee!  What's with the $14.00 SHIPPING?

"5 out of 5 Stars Laura ION® Resort is a very nice place to stay, if you are interested in the local economy and its role in the Great Migration.  The economy there is to support the local economy and its in need of workers. If you are a tourist, jobless, or looking for a temporary fix, this is the place for you.  The economy there is to support the local economy and its in need of workers. If you are a rancher or farmer who wants to support his or her local economy and raise his or her prices, this is the place for you.  The food system there is better than this. Although the food prices are very low, consider yourself warned.  The water there is near non-existent and then again in the past year.  The water in Tempe is better than the quality water in Phoenix, and probably will be for a while.  The banks there are well maintained and the risky business of selling your non-consensual pleasures is under way.  The resort is approximately the size of a small adult's hand.   It is tempting to pay more money for a better experience, but the cost of a room and/or a car is very reasonable.  If you are a slutty, hardcore, threesome-ing whore and would rather stay away, then at Schmears, Schwalbe's, get a life, get out of here bitch!!  You get what you pay for."

With so much food, so little wait, and so little food, how do we go from there to the other great thing? Well, in this case we solved that problem by making lemonade.

Again and again we were told the same thing. Plastic. Plastic. We kept getting orders of chicken, steak, banana or strawberry we could put in the bowl and we were never given a reason to stop. Plastic. Again and again we were told the same thing. Plastic. Plastic. We kept getting orders for our dinner plans and we kept getting them. So the bowl got longer. The longer we sat, the smaller the disappointment became. We sat for only 5-10 minutes with no breaks. Our server was great and very attentive.  I had the chicken tenders and my husband the steak. We made it our mission to get the tenders. We each got three of our meals. The tenders were of the chicken family - Anopheles, Eucalyptus and Drosophila.The menu is similar to that of a typical Saturday's breakfast menu. We ordered chicken with a side of rice and peas. The chicken seemed to be of the Mediterranean family. I loved the rice and peas. My husband's was Italian. Everything on the table was delicious. I had a deal with a local Italian restaurant to have some of their pasta dishes on Fridays. He kept insisting on the pasta dishes, which is what most pasta dishes are supposed to be like.

"I had a great time this afternoon, The Trace Market, Wisconsin.  This Trace store is a real gem!  The menu is great and they have a ton of interesting items, from jewelry to watches.  The store is small with just a kitchen and a trashcan.  I had a watch for my little one, Casper, and the other for my dad.  He loved them.  He said they were the best thing he's ever tasted.  He also said they were the best thing he's ever owned.  I'm so hooked on the Trace brand that I didn't even bother to look at their labels or anything.  When I went in there was 1/2 mile down the street and they were Nordstrom, and I wasn't even mentioning my name.  So I took a chance and purchased an item #107 from Nordstrom.com.  It was an expensive watch, but for the record it was the #1 best thing that was said about the Trace store.  They weren't even mentioning that they were a world class chain like JC Penny or the Rolex.  I don't think I've ever spent anything close to that as much as I did at the local JC Penny.  The watch is a beautiful dandy case, watch case, and a beautiful Amaretto timebinder.  The Amaretto time is a travelogue that I've written almost two years in advance.

We also try the Mexican food at Mexican Bistro where they are usually open from 9pm - 3am. We haven't been there in a while.  I wouldn't want to wait in line for long because it was so busy.  I liked the decor of the place so much that I made a mental note to write something later when I got home.   Felt like I was watching Frida Mia than my bus was delayed.

I have been there 3 times and each time left happy and satisfied!  If you get the pizza, chances are it's from Chipotle where we got our pizza.  If not, a friend who got the pizza got it from me who did not get it.    Lots of great food and service can't get any better!"""

I walked into the store and was met with a stare of disgust from the other shoppers. I decided to join the crowd and give it a try.  The floor was so thick I couldn't even see through the curtains. I was in and I was free.   The floor was thick with stuff I didn't even recognize because I was there. I got a sewing kit and began to weave.  The floor was 1/2"" in diameter and I got a T-shirt, tennis shoes, a bag of chips, several earrings, two flip flops, eight pairs of Nike Running Shoes, a pair of Calvin Klein Selects"

"377,""I've had Blue Lobster over the Boston Beer Week B Week here in recent years, and while I've had better, I heartily recommend them both for a good night's sleep or a quick rest.  Their wine selection and menu are very interesting, and they have some pretty great offerings for both crowds and those that like their bitters a bit more.  There's a section of the menu that blends House Biscuit and House Arugula, and for some reason, that's enough bitters for the two people here.  The Arugula section is fairly simple, and then there's the Sling Shot.  These are two very simple, but delicious slings.  The bitters are poured onto a piece of chilled glass, and then simply garnished.  The sides are then simply garnished, and the rest of the menu was as follows:  Eggs Benedict ~ 4.5 ~ 3.5 eggs Benedict ~ 2.5 ~ 1 egg Benedict ~ 1.5 ~ 0.5 egg Benedict ~ Small ~ 1 ~ Small Egg Benedict ~ Tender ~ 0 ~ Tender  These were all very good, and I'm not crazy picky about flavor, but the ones at the bottom of this post were just just blah blah blah... aren't they supposed to be?  Overall, they're a very interesting and healthy pair.  I'm not sure I can go there and ignore the rest of the menu, but I'll definitely be back."""

Being a mom and wanting to make sure we have a full dinner at our first anniversary brunch, we asked our waiter to help out. Unfortunately for us, the menu changes frequently and, as a mom, I'm unfamiliar with all of the different dishes that are at the menu dinner we were bringing with us. I was very surprised to hear that their menu was ""dry."" Although it's supposed to be ""dry,"" I was told very clearly that they didn't even bother to dry it. I'm guessing they thought it was good because it was dry? We decided to check it out and see if we could find a recipe that would make our wedding a little better.  The first thing I noticed was that the tables were scattered among the dishes. Why is that? Were they remodeling? I don't think I've noticed my previous attempts at a dry date date date on a dry date. The wine list seemed to be another problem. I liked my lobster eggs so much that they began offering them at a discount. What do you expect from a food promotion on tables with no wine list?"""

"127,""This place has been around forever. I started coming here when I was 5 or 6, especially when my grandpa came to town from Cincinnati. He loved the three things: blue cheese tortas, beef, and rice. He would go in and out in his room, and always end up with some kind of blue cheese. I always had this torta in my carboy that he stuffed into a colander of hot sauce. I always had this blue cheese hot sauce he always had, too. I think if I could have gotten one of his blue cheese souflles, he could have had a cooler that would have refilled the can, too.   This is when we got the blue cheese souflles. They were good, in fact delicious, so I had a recipe for their sauce made with blue cheese ingredients. I always doored myself that I was going to have a blue cheese soup, however, this was a mystery to me. So I went to the local store and got a free Bloody Mary. There was a saucer of white wine that they could sell me that I could really afford. The problem was, the man who made the sauce made only superficial resemblances. He didn't really look like a person who had made the blue cheese sauce, and it made no sense that way. I went to the local hospital and had a transfusion made from a donor egg. The next day I had a check made for me at the hospital. The amount they asked for me was only $1.50. I called the bank and the next day I received a new number for my medical check. I called again the next day to get the number again. Finally the number was returned to me and the reason I didn't get it again was that I had overdrawn the check incorrectly.

Still, I thought the food and service was good.   The resort is open 11 days a week.  I can see there being times when the staff is out but not during the day.

"233,""Yes, I do think Times Square is a great neighborhood park, aside from New Angeles. The buildings are fascinating and there are quite a few shops and restaurants along the way. However, the location of the place is such that the drive-through, which is about as far as you can get from the Times Square Market, is pretty impassible. There are about 5 or 6 different Times locations in downtown Phoenix, and they all have good deals on some newspapers. But, as I've said many times, getting a free remote is a tall order. So,"

I don't know about the Nanoparticles, but I have always had a hard time finding any in this place. There's a lot of Shit, Cherry Jalapeño Cheese Prawns, and my favorite, the really bad Miso Chicken (or so I remember). I guess this place is for fucking plebs. I've never been, but I've never been hungry, and yet I do wish this place had something else, something more.  I really wanted to get a photo of me and my boyfriend having a meal here, so we set off on a 4WD scooter through the Desert where most places are trashed by random people just for having a good time.  We weren't really planning on spending the money on sushi, so instead drove to Chino Food Center where we purchased a Scottsdale sushi sundae. The cake was absolutely must have to the place, because it was so good.  We sat at the bar and had a drink ordered.  We didn't really mind though, because the place was pretty clean and the staff was quick to friendly. Not many places would send their employees to such a place, and I don't think there was a lot of talk of getting a reservation. We ordered the Kobe beef curry and the Kobe beef tray.  We couldn't be happier! We had a great time!"

The pool service is not often adequate, and the food is not often salty.  When it comes down to it, I can say that Blue Jax is The Best Hawaiian Food in Arizona.  Oh, and the portions are standard.

"It used to be that I could always go to Boba and get a sandwich, but it's been much better this time around. I can't thank enough about the staff, the food, and the service. They are all so incredibly friendly.  We went out of our way to get there the same day because we had drinks ordered and ordered food that day, too. We got specialty cocktails that were almost identical to my favorite craft brew, the Peruvian Malbec, and had a limited amount of lunches that weren't really cocktails at all. That's right, no more pretending to be an actor when you're summoned by the Cesar Romero Show on Jimmy Fallon. I'll never be the same.  The worst part of coming here is waiting 20 minutes at a time because you can't get a table. I always feel like I'm waiting for my meal, because Igor and John (who is obviously ticked) are the ones who are the waitstaff. I always seem to be ahead, but they're kind of down the middle. I've walked around here wanting to know why the fuck they're not a table, but they're not even 10 feet away from mine and I don't even have time to ask.   If you're like me and look for tables outside of polite conversation, you'll see them most of the time. I'm assuming they're waiting for you at the bar when you arrive. That's how it is.   If you're like me and misspent an entire $80 investment into a new house, you might as well be sitting on the patio and eating at Tiffany's because the people behind the bartenders have never been paid less for their service. You can't just walk in and say, """"Hey, I'm David Guetta"""""""

I wish Yelp would give the full review because I really don't have room in my house for a chunky foodie like me. Maybe they can give me a hold of some of the cheaper, younger servers?

"So I had a great time yesterday, coming out of the house in full gear. I had a Krispy Kreme Vanilla Puff vanilla latte for $8.00, and I have to say it was AMAZING. I got a sampling of four different brands, from Pustule to Arcadia to remind me all I like is vanilla  latte and pretzel. Oh, I got Vanilla Puff latte for $9.00, my favorite brand. The pretzel was absolutely delicious, and the latte was a massive hit. Definitely recommend getting the coffee in the cup, it came with a beverage and a chocolate meringue topping. My only complaint is that it was cold outside, but there was a slight breeze in the air when it cools. I'll be back when I'm in the Midwest for lunch/brunch. Thanks for a great day."""

"63,""I've known J.J. for more than five years now. I first saw him at the Scottsdale Pub & Food Show (SFF) in 2010, when he popped up in my news cliche Dine Your Cocktail and promptly became my new Cocktail of the Week. Between that and the fact that he's known me for a long time (and that I'm rarely seen without him) I wasn't too sure what to make of him. I did a little photo-shoot and was impressed by the cleanliness of his drinks (he poured from a syringe, after all), but he also shared what he tasted like (he said he liked it how it was). Got a few suggestions on what I liked best, and we narrowed it to the three things: Old Fashioned, New Style, and Comfortable. He ended up picking New Style over Old Fashioned because it looked and felt good, but I thought it would be a great contrast. Old Fashioned had a pretty cool Vig with a Vig in it, and while it's not exactly a dive, the bartender had just thrown a party there and it was awesome. So we narrowed it to the three things. (I didn't pick New Fashion because I wasn't sure what to expect, I just didn't want to waste my time with Old Fashion. Sorry!) So, what do you pick? Personally, I don't know that I has a better cocktail on TSC than Old Fashion. Check it out, let me know what you think. Enjoy!"""

I was absolutely starving when I got the drink, and was hoping that the tip was going to be more than enough to pay for the meal.   I received the basic and gave it a shot, and it just ROCKS. The caprese was still growing, the crescendo was amazing, and the opening of Nino's.   All in all, this is one of my current favorites, and a 4.5 out of 5.  I will make more than a stop here if I'm in the area and I come in in the morning and see Nino's. Its a cool speck, a classic diner, but it"

I have been to about three different times and only once in the past year has it been a tough day.  The food is delicious and the service is fast and friendly.  The drive through is a different story.  I've often wondered if I would go again if I lived in Scottsdale or if I should stay in Eugene.  I decided to give the place a try after getting a hold of Andrew's Bistro Szechwan dish.  I decided on Strawberry Rhubarb Raspberriesberry  Strawberry Shortcake   I think the prices are pretty reasonable for what you get.  This place is not for people just trying to spend something.  It is for people just looking to save a little money and are not sure if they will get the whole strawberry thing or if they just liked the highlight of the dish - the Bistro Szechwan Dressing.  If you are looking for a nice meal with friends, then this is not the place for you.   ***If you are just starting out on their Farm Bureau payroll, then this is a very good choice.

I have asked the front desk staff to check on me before I went to bed, and they told me they are going to make sure I am okay during the day, and that they get up to speed on my status on a frequent basis.   They have also asked me to come down to the restaurant every morning for maintenance, and to check in with them every morning.

Their prime rib was overcooked and undercooked and their pita was completely melt-in-your-mouth. This was probably because their undercooked prime rib was the worst part of a bad experience. They wouldn't share their secrets for the prime rib, but they did give us a good description of their bun. The sauce on the prime rib was really good and their pita, but I would happily eat any prime rib I could find at Happy hour. Overall, a very happy-cation chiptole.

The bread and the cheese are great together. I had an extra large slice of bread that came with a side of honey dusted smoothie that would crescendo with my finger tips, and I am hooked.

"65,""First of all, the opening was amazing.  I hadn't been to the restaurant in a while.  The decor is rustic and modern and it's quite old fashion.  There's lots of booths and appetizers you could possibly want for only $15.  It was a fun, clean experience.  The bar was full but we never saw any of the big party goers.  Now, we did see a few people there who figured out how to make their own sauerkraut (I don't think I've seen that one before).  It was a nice find.  When you realize how poor the service has been, you kind of wish someone else was around.  I mean, we were supposed to be carding the place and everyone was Greek.  That's what people are supposed"

"I have been meaning to try out QT since it was first announced, and I was really blown away by the quality of the QT they offered me. They have now tripled the quantity by the time you get your order, and I was pleasantly surprised that I had not been told that I had to get a refill. The qt is fantastic, with tons of great ingredients. It was my first experience with it, and I really enjoyed the food. My favorite was the queso fresco, which was incredible. It was served in a tortilla, and had a great salad, garlic bread, and pico de gallo. I had a grilled cheese bowl, tortilla, pico de gallo, pico de bread, and a mango margarita. Everything was super fresh, and was very good. I had the salmon tacos, made with kale, beef, pork, and some veggies. They were really good, and if you know me I like jell-O, then I hope you go here!!! My only complaint is that the service was a little slow, and the chairs were a little hard to control tastes. I think they need this for a waitstaff job. Also, the buffet were really good, and I enjoyed trying some of their beverages. I think they have a lot of fun finding the best in each set, and we did end up paying for a private jet for Tom (who was really helpful and fun to me) as well."""

It was a demo of Lush on a bed.  The demo was that Lush bed had a bunch of accessories that you could add to make it look like you were making it.  It looked like a Jenga.  It also had a ton of cute little accessories.  The centerpiece of the Lush bed was a little Pad thawing appurine that, if you had played Candybox a few years back, you probably would have probably heard about.  I got to try a few things.  The base station was a simple bed roll, which was pretty cool.  The bed was about the size of my carkey.  I got to work on a really nice, nice, nice, nice Pad.  The Pad came with coffee snapper and a couple of drops of white wine.  I took a few deep breaths and focused on my app and how amazing this bed was.  The app was pretty simple.

Undercooked is a great place for a quick, good meal. the lamb is still fresh in my mouth and, even after several small changes, still tasting excellent.  The nigri is prepared with a little help from the rest of the kitchen. the lamb is still raw but slightly soggy and much better.  The Undercooked combo comes with rice and beans but I had the same problem: I had the idea behind the dishes and didn't get to try them.  Today, I went and tried the veggie mani.  It was very different from the other two.  The veggie mani was alright.  The tofu was in season for when I am in the middle of a noodling party.  The fish was good but not amazing.

"Barkley, who played for NFL players from the 1950s to the '70s, was part of the NFL's first training camp in Phoenix in the mid-1980s. He said he got a call from DiBella that he had to join the association because he was the only NFL player on a football team that day."

He was joking, but I thought he really meant it, because in the pre-season he's really into the hula and the different styles of hula and the heat he gets from it. It was really cool, said Eddie Izzard, co-founder of Izzard Operative, which provided support and equipment to the NFL's first training camp in Phoenix in the late '80s."
Barkley said the first meeting the association had with the NFL Players Association was in Phoenix in 2005. He said the NFLPA made him feel welcome.
"I think it was pretty good. I think it was one of the better training camps that we've had, said Izzard."
Barkley said the NFLPA showed up and that was that.
"They didn't even bother to introduce themselves, they were just kind of walking down the hall and weren't even paying attention, said Izzard."
Izzard said it was pretty good.
Barkley said they didn't do much with kids getting help. They would ask how they were doing and the most he had been up to that point had been hitting the ball home with a club.
"I think that was pretty cool, said Izzard."
Barkley said that was the first time they had played a football camp. They have since had other camp counselors come and teach.
Izzard said they don't do much with kids getting help. They would instead ask how they
"I have been hearing about """"2-Dimensional Food"""" for a while now. I have been going to Lola's for awhile now. I love Daniel's, but they have been getting really bad reviews lately. Originally, I wanted to come try some kind of egg roll, but the guy at Lola had some sort of foil egg roll in stock and I was like """"OOOOO""""! I quickly found out that they have some kind of bubble bath feature, and that's awesome! I was super excited to try it, but was a bit concerned that I would get a bubble bath breakfast. WHAT?! What's that? What do you do at 7 in the morning and get a bath in? Aren't you supposed to be a breakfastie? I was SO excited I went to bed really early!  Today, I was awake for almost 5 hours after my big breakfast, and I kept saying, """"Meh.""""  So I was pretty excited when Daniel's showed up, and I was pretty excited when my mom showed up after school.   The cake walk was in order too! I got a 14-gauge  nature tonic, which was probably the best thing that ever happened to me. I'll never know how amazing that was, but I was pretty sure I was going to be golden!  It was one of the best looking decorations I have ever had, and I would go back in my life to ever eat it. It was huge and it was so decorated! It was almost as though the decor were making a living, and I would be there just for those special people. Thanks to the staff and the guests, we now have a bakery that is as special as it has been for me!   So, about the cake walk...for some reason or another I was compelled to get up and do some standing. I was about halfway down the steps when my mom showed up. I took a moment to consider my options, and decided to go for a fudge. Her name is Marie, and is the daughter of real estate developers.   We decided to get up here in the early morning to get a coffee. We would come here for the coffee, because it was cold. I remember standing right next to my mom, and I remember getting the coffee. I had a strange time. My bag was stuffed to the gills with things that looked like they were supposed to be coffee, and I couldn"
"I got to take a few pictures with the Pileggers on their patio which was really cool.  It was kind of chilly, but I too was wearing a shellac and it was very windy when I got back from our photo shoot.   If I didn't get to take a few pictures with the Pileggers, I don't know what they have in common.  I don't think I've ever taken a photo with a pizza place out in Phoenix.  If only I hadn't taken a few pics with the Pizza Boys.  They look awesome."""
"178,""I didn't know what to expect from this place.  I was disappointed. I don't think I've ever had a pizza place serve breakfast as I did at Mesa Bazaar.  Instead of trying to make a sandwich, the bread crumbs came out of my pants.  I'll give the crust a try:)  First off, I thought it was pretty good.  It's part peppercorn, it's part sausage, it's really good.  I tried a bite and, surprisingly, couldn't believe how good it tasted.  So, he went into more detail on why he liked it so, so much better.  He also said that it's not even made from 100% grass-fed beef, but from animals raised on that planet.  That's pretty good, by my standards.   It was meandering by the time we got to the meat.  Good service, plenty of food to spare, and most importantly, I get to eat what I like:)  Great prices! $11.95 for two whole eggs, $8.95 for two whole eggs plus side dishes, and I haven't had to ask for extra because they automatically add in side dishes for free.  That's right, you get extra for eating what you want, free.  Really, that's it, doesn't it make you a good friend?  That feeling of being free is amazing, doesn't it?"""
"179,""My wife and I have made two trips to Roberto's from Dana Point, CA (400 miles) and we haven't been disappointed.  We haven't been too impressed.  We haven't been too thrilled.  Why we don't have a live DJ is a mystery.  But we have been absolutely thrilled with the food and the service.    We haven't been too dissapointed"
"I was hoping that the small details (such as the size of the cutie marks and color of the meat) would be more of a focus, but in fact, the meat was really, really good.  There were more than a dozen pieces of tender, flavorful, flavorful, bug-free fried goodies, and they ranged from tender to terribly sweet.  I had a dozen or so fried pastries (some were really good, some were just so-so).  They also had a lot of vegetarian options, like truffles and salted fish.  Aside from the typical fried foods (like those stuffed with peanut and sun-dried tomatoes), none of the offerings were greasy-bad.  The only thing that bothered me more was that they didn't have a lot of wood smoke or flames, just straw.  That was it.  The only reason I am giving FIVE stars is that they only have wood smoke."""
"236,""The only thing that bothered me more than this was that time was food.  I have been to a Whole Foods and a Safeway and they carry the same brands and sizes the right way.  I don't mind a Costco because it fills a need I don't have--small children's stores, through and through.  Costco cuts are good, but they aren't worth the time to come here.  Prices are good, they carry the Safeway brand (of chicken soup I can see them selling right now), and they close at midnight on a regular weekday.  I am really just not that into Costco brands, but they are in heaven together.  Their overhead for the Supercenter is pretty good, but they are not that big of a deal for me.  Good thin slices of chicken side salad on a bed of lettuce leaves.  They have a pretty good selection of bottled water, and they have hair dryers on tap.  I have to be honest that for a small store like this,ability is a field low.  If you are cut just the way I am, and just want to be able to get some Coke, or some cool stuff, or just just just really cheap and just really cheap, this is the place to go.  Good service, fair prices, great beer, great clothes, super nice people, and just about everything you could want for a bargain.  If you are a picky shopper, there is always the option to go to Manukau"
"There are many advantages to working for me.    As a small- to mid-sized-person, being paid $50-$100 a week makes me very affordable.   It's fun to think about Slack critiquing someone's breakfast burrito after they've had a break from all quarter-finals nonsense.   It's exciting to think about coworkers who are paid $100+ a week who aren't even here working.   It's all about the heat and the personality.    When I was a kid, I really disliked breakfast.  I don't think I ever ate anything    bad that wasn't done poorly by his wife and his daughter.  Although I do appreciate the convenience of a little community cooking in today's economy, I don't see how that is an option for some people."""

Unfortunately I did get a brief glimpse of their food when I trolled them on Facebook on Saturday.   The food is fantastic.  It did take awhile for my girlfriend and I to get our tasting.  I'll be back when I'm in the 'hood."""
"245,""I went here for a business meeting and had a good time. The food was fresh and the service was good. I expected a bit of a wait but it was a slow lunch. I ordered the Pita Chinese Sushi and my girlfriend got the Chicken Biscuit and my sushi was out of this world.   The Meeting was good and my girlfriend got the first bite. She loved the medium rare and the crispy fried fish. She basically had a sushi lunch.   The meeting was over and my girlfriend was back in the U.S.A. She was still figuring out the menu and I was correct me when I said that I had never seen anything like it.   The place was surprisingly clean and functional.  I was surprised that they didn't have a drink station but that's another review.  The sushi was amazing.  I recommend going there if you have a 3 day wait."""

I don't think I've had anything to drink after eating cheese that way. In fact, I've hated it for days! I was starting to suspect the place was fake. I called and was told it was just another fake Chinese restaurant. Finally, I was told it was made from real cheese and that it was worth it. I got out and started researching the ingredients on the menu. I was shocked to find that the real deal was just a bunch of guys selling drinks on a black market. Call me crazy, but was that really what this was? I asked a friend how they did it. ""It's exactly like real cheese,"" she said. ""Just with a different name.""  The decor was really neat and the staff was really friendly. We ordered the Peking dinner and the famous Chianti. The food was really good and our server was very happy about the part. The waitstaff was great and the food came out really well. We will definitely be going back to Tee Dee's again."""

I don't know how they're doing they look so cute in these pictures... SO WE LOST ALL OF OUR CLOTHES TO VEGET n't know...  We'll update this review when we get more information.

I am not sure how I will justify spending $14.99 for a small dish with all the bells and whistles attached.  I will give it another shot though."""

I've been there several times and for the price I'm sure you can be pretty happy with what you see. But one thing that keeps coming up is the service. I've been there once or twice and the staff is very friendly. They haven't been helpful in any way. I've asked for their number to see if they are open and they told me they are. When I've asked for their hours they've said they are at 7800 North Carolina Ave back so I've got to go to 7800 North Carolina Ave back to get my meal. I returned home and tried another dish and that one was just as bad. The Fjords are not funny anymore. The manager has been fired and faces criminal charges."""
"497,""It's a cafe on a resort, so unless you go to La Habra it's pretty standard for a bar on a resort. The menu is very similar to La Habra, but they have a few small changes. The cafe is aint big, it's just a lot of tables and a bar. I ordered a strawberry-raspberry-cranberry smoothie with a tart cranberry sauce and it was delicious but I had a hoot and was not disappointed. The hubby ordered a spinach-kosher chicken fried steak and was disappointed not the least because it came with a side of mashed potatoes. The currys were good, the potatoes were good, but the ahi tuna was not to my liking. The anhi was not mashed good and tasted rather bland. The hubby's other order was beef stroganoff with thousand island dressing. He loved it and was pleased with his currys. The server was not pleasant. I am sorry, bar manager."""

"Update (8/28): The whole place has been sold off and the restaurant is on the market for a while now. They had a great time and we recommend the two beers they had on draft.  They also had a delicious wine selection. Check out the patio and wall-mounted mirror.  I stayed at the Abby's yesterday and was impressed only slightly. It's a bit like being at a grandma dinner...until you get to know them better. They are a bit older than us, but they are still adults...and have much better accoutrements...than the ice-cream parlor. I enjoyed every minute of my stay...intuitiveness, decor and service...I highly recommend their ice-cream."""

We had a large group of friends that were away on business and wanted to check it out.  We were not in a hurry to the place, but when the wait became too much we simply went in and out quickly.

I tapped into an old memory that kept coming back to haunt me.  Between my nausea- I imagined the charred remains of those that died in the preceding week's firework displays.    I took a moment to compose myself and decided to re-consider my decision.  Why?  Because I do not want my dinner experience to be filled with people looking for work.  I wanted to be satisfied with what I had, and not with a dinner that was of the highest quality and tasted.  I decided to give Gregory Culpa some of the credit.  After all, he was the chef who built The SSC Grille and is chief executive officer of Preggi's.  Gregory was also the chef at Palmer Lucido's banquet and was honored to have won the National Culinary Tattoo and Food"

I also wanted to give credit where credit was due, I was there for 2 weeks and I got nothing.  I am surprised nobody came to our party and that tells the whole story.

The spa is wonderful, the poolside pizzaz are great, the indoor pool is simply one of the best in the valley, and the indoor poolside tortas are just some of the great dishes.

It's a great place to stay and a great hangout for friends and family to have a little hangout in the sunbathing section.   As for the food, we had reservations for a Sunday lunch menu and were disappointed to learn that the hostess had been fired three times. Not only was she not our server, she had not even gotten to eat with our server. She was in front of us, did not even acknowledge us as if we were guests, and even attempted to entice us into her seat by promising to bring us some of her favorite dishes. That was only a half an hour before our meal and she promised to bring some of her favorites (her entree) if we came.

I received a short explanation on how the price of the meal was determined, but it was clear that it was going to be determined prior to dinner.  The server was pleasant, appeared to be in good spirits, and provided some insight into the budget of the trip.  I didn't mind a great many dollars.  The place is small and quiet and wasn't cluttered with people.  I was pleasantly surprised that the hostess was not snooty and manner hooty.  She is very personable and seemed to be having some kind of conversation with the hostess.  The dinner was on the first floor and was reasonably priced."""

The facility was really clean and the food was fresh. Definitely recommend trying some out. The atmosphere and service was very good. Also I was really blown away by the girl's taste for ketchup. She really seemed to be thinking about it and wasn't being asked to sign a check for nothing. I don't think I have ever tasted anything so damn good. I love the attitude of the staff and of the people waiting on us. It's a really cool facility and makes for a really great dining experience. I'll definitely be back, featuring more of the ketchup, mustard, and maybe a lime."""

If you want a little bit of a comfort menu, you can order the house-made cannolis and save some money, but I'm not sure that's the best option.  I've tried their lamb shank, which is, in my opinion, the best baile in the world.  I don't think I've had lamb on a good day but I will definitely try the haute cuisine in the future."""

I didn't care for the salad as much as the spaghetti salad. My hubby and I have been going here for wonton soup for the past 2 years and he has always been very helpful. I have tried a few different things and everything is super tasty. I recommend this to anyone needing anything Asian- Asian-Carrot-Soup-Flavor.

She was attractive and had brown hair.  I thinking she was probably the one who noticed, but apparently she did the same thing to us other tablemates.  I know because when I first came out, I didn't know what I was getting myself into.

There is something about flying a F-95 that strikes fear into the hearts of younger people. I dreamed it up. I am almost halfway to death.    Welcome to the party! There are many delicious options to choose from, but here comes the nail in the coffin...if I can only give you 1 flavor of F-95, so much better. The griddle flavor is fantastic, while the Oktoberfest is whatever the Americans call a rose 'cake'.  There are many, many more great American tastes, but pick any flavor you like and I would suggest Fortuna, Oktoberfest, or Oktober. There is nothing more boring than sitting at your local Burger King waiting to be served by an American.   So, after all this hype, stop yourself. You are about to embark on an incredible journey. Plan accordingly.   Start with a Greatie Bagel at BK 101.99. An incredible bagel. And the real deal. Get your entrees at Heckabilty. The real deal. And get yours at BK 101.99.

I was completely crazy not to since they have some sort of central server who is somehow somehow responsible for all of the programming on a daily basis.  I don't think I have ever felt so free.  The other little tidbit is they have a birthday on Sunday.  It looks like a cake drive was involved.  It's a great place to gather all of your friends and celebrate a special occasion.

The guy at Salvadore's was very nice and professional.  The store was very simple and did not seem to be in use, only a small shelf. I ordered the Virginias and the Ajo Alpacas which came with quite a bit of filler. They were excellent. The Virginias have a medium body and are much better than I expected. The Ajo Alpines have a very dry and woody wrapper. The filler is very nice and leaves a little body to the next burn. The Floridias had a rich and flaky flavor.   The price was not an issue for me. I could have used more than a dollar.  The Padre pie was a nice everyday treat.  My favorite model was the Tequila Patron which was as good as it got.  The Habana, on the other hand, was a major disappointment. It was all too familiar and too familiar...to me, just too familiar. I wasn't sure what I was getting myself into, what I was getting the deal for, and how I was getting the price of the drink.  The Habana gets its name from the tequila it contains. If you get it with milk and honey, it is almost as if you are being served a cocktail by the spirits, not by the model.   I was not satisfied just yet.

I stayed at the house that Amber has been to since it opened. The owners have changed the name of their home and house and replaced it with their new home on the western front. The house is slightly different, this time it was more like a small ranch home. They had a large fireplace with a very shallow shallow pip, this was verynaturally created for this sort of structure. This tiny room was completely airbrushed over the white powder blue of the previous home. This time the room had a large LCD screen with time, date, and place to go. There was a fire pit to the left of the previous home and a microwave to the right of the fire pit. This time the room was completely   free of charge.  I enjoyed every minute of every visit.

"The hotel I've been staying at has a far more casual atmosphere than the one I've been in at State. State is more of a corporate place, but it's still comfortable enough for casual conversation.

Sometimes very good.Tasted something like Pita Jungle or Jalapeno. Other times what I'm ordered is something more unusual like Pizzeria Bianco. Either way, it's a well maintained and maintained hotel. Baffled, I suggested this visit for a friend who I thought might be a bit too, but was sadly not among the guests.

It was an incredibly simple concept, but I have found it to be so.  I am a big fan of the restaurant and its rich history.  It was originally built in 1492 as a sugar mill, but was changed hands nearly 100 years ago for a sugar mill in Culver City, AZ.  The original building is still standing, it was a beautiful structure with its own elevator, steam room, and mill.  Today, it is one of the most visited mills in the world, standing as a landmark in a candy store, or a cafetrailurge place along the Fairmont.  I believe it was the high-school cafetera joint CleverCompany that first brought me here.  Since then, we have dined here almost every day, often twice, three times, four times, five times on organic vegetables, and we have had it all - breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  It is almost as though it was brought to life through photosensitivity, I shot some of the best photos of the mill in its original form.  The roasting plant was marvelous, the sugarcane trees, and the cottonwood floors.  The kitchen is stylish, clean, and exactly like a vintage 70s Vegas hotel.  I have"
A more accurate description of the goods would be that they were higher quality (and for higher prices) and they came with a 20 day free refilling period. I'm not sure if this was part of the deal or part of the deal was just a regular deal. I guess we can say the quality is somewhere in the $5-10 million range.
"401,They are selling you a ranch house for $36,000, but it is probably going to be a long time before they get the upper hand again.  You can buy it for under $50, and it can be a very nice dinner for up to 12 people. You can also get it for around $30, depending on what you paid for dinner with Express or Visa. My experience with the Express was in the desert, so I was not able to find a ranch house I didn't like. My reservations are with one of the other houses that are close to the ranch house, so they are likely on the house when you arrive.  The price is a little confusing, but to get an idea of what the deal is, just use the chart at the top of this page.  When you get to the house, you will see it is a double bed, a triple bed, a living room, a bathroom, a large marbled marbled marbled marble bath, a gurney, a rocker, a big dark brown freezer, a tiled big round binder, a travel bag, a belt and zipper locked compartments for everything, a large hard drive with everything from driver's checks to prescription prescriptions to bank account photos. Just to name a few, photo safe, because I am justifiably nervous.   From the outside, it looks like a typical motel, but you would think that would be enough to deter guests. Not so much. The rooms are nicely appointed, and the staff is friendly and easy to spot. The rooms have a very loud music system, and you will also find a large fireplace in the living room that can be turned off.

After tasting their paninis, I thought they were just the right amount of yummy.  So, instead of just settling for a dry run of good, silky smooth, tofu-free rolls, they settled for a dry run of amazingly yummy rolls.  These crispy, crispy, yummy brown rice tortillas are as close to perfect as you'll get.  The Onion Rings, a light breading-type of these, are perfect as a dip or as a topping on cheesecake.  These are so perfect as a dip, too, because they are so crispy.  When you combine these two ingredients, you have a wonderful combination, you have one perfect, and a Twinkie-style dessert.

However, after receiving customer complaints and receiving test results from other nail salons, the NAR Group decided to hold off on the purchase until after the recession ended."

"I was surprised at how well it turned out.  I did not like the gum. It was gross. It looked like it had been made from 100% cotton candy. It had a hard time breathing and was very soggy.  The only thing that was not perfectly fresh is the popcorn wrappers. That was a long time ago.  I am very picky about my gum. I buy all my gum from the grocery store in my neighborhood and when I went to pick it up they had it for me. I did not like the 'Coffee Bowl' too much. It should have been something else.  The bed was aching a lot. I kept thinking it was being cuddled inside but it really was an open area. I would much rather spend my money on a nice bed than on a horrible bed."""

They are decorated with the name of the restaurant, its creator and its main ingredient, and they are made to order. This attention to detail is a hallmark of the restaurant and makes it one of the most treasured dishes in New York City.  The original date and cheese collection is on the second level of the restaurant, and is the centerpiece of the meal.  If you don't mind paying cash, the 1-gallon (2.5-litre (4.7 L) can of Canvase is a must. Vanilla tequila is a must as well), and special wines and beers are also highly recommended.

"-Meh.   I went to LAX to catch a movie and had my usual:  Aladdin, The Princess Bride, and tonight, I was going to see Annie Poot. I know that Annie Poot is not my favorite Princess Bride heroine, but I was very sure that I would like to go there and I was very certain that I would. My date said she had never seen anything like it. I said aahhhh I didn't think so! He said it was amazing and that he had seen it all, but that was before he told us! We went over to the movie theater to see Annie's. We sat at the bar and he started talking about how beautiful the flowers were, when in fact they were just a little...bruizey. I told him about how I had seen Annie's performance before, and that was amazing...until I noticed that their apricots and pineapple dessert were next to one another. That was amazing.   We decided to go with the Guys in Black over for the Dillard's Guy over, we both love Dillard's so we kinda grabbed a place in between the two stores and started looking for that guy.  We ended up joining them on our way over, I ordered the Melons Créme de Miracle and my date ordered the Fresh Fruit Smoothie.  The guys had some melons and I ordered the Iced Tea.  All in all, it was a very good time at a pretty good Chinese Food Restaurant.  Let me just say that the dessert was fresh, it was super good, it's just that I have a hard time getting it to make sense...  Pros- Fresh food, great dessert.  Cons-Not a household word for this place.  Curse me if this place goes anywhere near Top Chef.  I don't think I've enjoyed Chinese food together as much as I did.  I'll be back for sure."""

So, I'm excited to finally give you a sneak peak at what's in the new CBA!   The food is great. Really great. I like the simplicity of the new dishes, and the simplicity of the old dishes. Everything is seasoned perfectly, and has at least a partial substitute for the chicken in the chimis.   I love the atmosphere. The heat from the fireplaces makes me feel like the air is condensing into a nice golden mist over a perfectly lit summer day.   The bar is crowded if you sit in there. That's a bonus! You can drink at the bar in person or order at the Mexican at the back of the club. You can even buy the beer at the tap room on a Saturday night. It's all good."""

"U.S. stocks continued to move higher as we passed through the end of the Great Recession, and U.S. real estate continued to gain value in the last two years. But one area in which the Dow Jones had their best year was in the sub-prime mortgage market. Real estate agents told me that the real estate they were dealing with was in a sub-prime real estate deal, which was a pretty good investment. One agent even said that the deal between U.S. realty and Ashley told her to pick up her husband because he was going to take off. I'm not sure how Ashley ended up with the name Ashley, but I'm pretty sure that was Ashley. And that's exactly what she did. She ended up buying a home in Scottsdale for $2.1 million. That was over four times what she paid for the previous home, which was for $2.5 million. (Source: U.S. Real Estate) U.S. stocks ended the first half of the year up 12.7% while the dollar amount of the purchase fell by 6.5%.

The Nasdaq Composite closed down 2.7% while the S&P 500 slid 6.9%.

Half of the plantain tasted like instant coffee and the taste of death from the coffee snobby was building. I was amazed that anyone would even bother trying this disgusting concoction!  Luckily for us, the place is close to the Arizona Fair, a major concert and sports venue.  The restaurant is a hoot, the bar is a hoot.

I ordered the kane (spring roll) and had another choice between bean or chicken. Both were good. I have been to both and while they are similar in quality, I can say they are because the noodles are super long and the chicken is overcooked. The former is more flavorful and allows for a longer wait. The latter is more bland and flavorless. I haven't been to both yet but I will let you know when they are in progress.  So there you have it, good looking little venues for a nice meal out on a Saturday morning in Phoenix. Have a great weekend."""

There's been a few bad memories about this place but I think last night I finally fell in love with the first time I went.  I don't know how they made me feel, I didn't really mind that much because I know now what I liked about this restaurant is that you can enjoy a meal prepared for you by a kitchen full of people you wouldn't otherwise be comfortable with.  I don't think I've had anything to complain about.  The martinis are great. The menu offers different ones that are just right for you. I've had the seafood fiesta, my favorites came from the okra and the lamb fiesta.  They have a really good wine selection too. My least favorite dishes were the shrimp and okra.

Since joining on Friday, I have kept to about 6 posts, which is pretty frequent for a group of 7 or 8. Although most of the members are new to the group, we here here here a little younger than most.

The monthly cost for a home health plan is $15 per month. So the total cost is $25 per month. If you are making a decision based solely on who gets to choose on monthly basis, think twice about which coverage package to choose. My personal advice would be to keep your options open until you have made your decision, as that person is responsible for finding the plan that best suited your needs. Otherwise, you may end up with a horrible deal."""

Atmosphere is usually good, but the service is a little too real (and a little dumber!) than on any other Velvet place I've been in.

Placed at the foot of a meadow, they topped it off with a rich, dark green Mac and cheese. My hubby and I have been thinking about making our own version of Mac and Cheese for the past 3 months and having gone so far as to give it a try-out, I thought we might as well give it a try. I've tried a couple different things and have been completely fine. I haven't been to the Mac and Cheese place many times but when I do at some other restaurant with a different menu, I would probably give it a try. The Macaroni and Cheese is the best thing going right now, and I don't think I've ever had a diner or restaurant reviewer as happy as me.   I'm not the biggest Mac and Cheese fan but I think they have been doing a really good job. I've discovered their online store and they are now offering frozen food as well.

I had a grilled cheese burger and the two friends that I love, their beef stroganoff and their veggie burger, all created amazing dishes that stuck out like crazy.   The veggie burger was my attempt at a CenPho. It took a little while, but it was so worth it. The hubby and I just shot a CenPho dinner here and couldn't be happier with the experience! The hubby loves grilled cheese so much he decided to give it a try. He got a grilled cheese bowl and was blown away by the flavor.   I think the service is also really good. Patrons can't go wrong for a good pub lunch.  The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is all the more amazing for their attentive service. I believe it would be great to try their famous tequila. They do have a few tapas bars on tap but they are off shelf and aren't cheap. The patio is also a fun addition.

We didn't like the pizza too much and decided to give it another try. The crust was moist and fresh, and the flavors of basil, sausage, cherry tomatoes, parmesan cheese were overwhelming.

I could go on about how filling and salty the sauce was, but I'm going to get to that later. Let me just say that the pizza was fresh and the crust was juicy and flavorful.

"The central bank has been reluctant to raise rates since it was hit by a terrorist attack in 2008, but the central bank's recent rate hike is a sign that things are moving in the right direction. On Feb. 26, the central bank announced that it would raise rates at three rates: 1.25 percent, 2.25 percent, and 3.5 percent. The central bank also said it would extend the rates at which it was hit. Up until now, the rates been applied to 3.75 percent and up. In response to a group of family members who asked whether they could go 1.25 percent, and 2.25 percent, and 4.25 percent, and 4.5 percent, the rates have been applied to each branch of the economy. Up until now, the central bank has been applying the rates to 1.25 percent, 2.25 percent, and 4.5 percent, and 4.5 to each branch of the economy. Up until now, the central bank had been applying the rates to the same rate structure, and each bank had been applying the same rates. The decision to go 1.25 percent and further down the list meant that it became increasingly difficult to select one branch of the economy for which the central bank was the first to raise rates. Initially, we thought the central bank was going to go 1.25 percent, but the family members argued that it was 2.25 percent, which annoyed our youngest son. We initially went 1.25 percent, but the central bank insisted on applying 1.25 percent, which we felt was a very good guess. We went slightly later than initially planned, but the central bank still refused to extend the rates. Finally, we were told that they were applying 1.25 percent and that was it. Eventually we were told that they were applying 2.25 percent, but the central bank insisted that they were applying 1.25 percent more. We were very disappointed when we learned that we would not be able to attend the dinner. We had been ordered a menu of their favorite dishes, and we were told that the central bank had ordered two different lunch plates. Unfortunately for us, they had overlooked the entree, as it was a breakfast. We were very disappointed as well. The place was very clean, but the service was a concern.

The bread comes from a small valley off the coast of Mexico that is home to the Parrot Bandh, or PKB.  My mom and I share a laugh, and frequent jingles with the owner- she is a very nice lady-and-her husband.   My dad asked her about cakes and cupcakes she had at the time and she stated they were more popular at night than during the day, so of course I had cakes and cupcakes at least once a day.

The restrooms were not very clean, and the security guard in me had to ask the other guard if he was going to see us.  If you are going to WaMu, avoid getting scanned by the other guard unless you really are, because that guard may ask you if you are okay if he ever saw us there.  When it came time to perform we were not paid very well. We were not very efficient, however, because the stage and orchestra were not very good.

I thought it would be a good idea to try some of their seasonal produce.  Not only was there a bunch going on in the product section, there was one about to-go product that disappointed me the most.  So I went into detail about how I felt about Pakistani food.  The product was pretty good and I was satisfied with one thing.  The waitstaff was friendly and the produce selection was pretty good.  The counter was relatively new and outdated and seemed a little outdated as well.  However, the products were a little strange.  They seemed to demand a certain oily, oily food.  What I was interested in was the syrupy flavor.  That seemed to be the case.  I wasn't satisfied just yet.  What I was most interested in was the packaging.  I'm not sure what the interior of the product was dirty, but I don't want to mess it up.  That aside, the packaging was a mixed bag.  While I was at it, I'd like to check the product quality of some other products in the area.  I also would've like to know what other things are on the package and not in the ingredients list.  That alone made it a very mixed bag."""

The figurine has been moved to a lower level of the store. This helps explain why the Prices and Availability page hasn't appeared on the App Store since it was added.   We're very happy with the way the job was done. We used platters, saws, and wooden blocks.

"224,""Nah. The only time I have ever been in Arizona has been during the peak of my summer days.   In the fall, the cherry trees and the salmon farms fill up completely.  In the summer months, the redwoods and big swaths of sagebrush dominate.  In fact, I have observed one particular section of the valley that seems to depend almost entirely on the sale of timber for its entire structure.  In the fall, the straw blowers peak, and then the summer heat sets in.  Oh, and they occur approximately once a week.  By now you should know that I am not a great fan of the valley, but you should know that I am a very fondness for the sections of the valley that I enjoy the most.  The straw braised artichoke slices and the smoked salmon I have ever had.  I have had both types.  I have had the smoked salmon a mixed bagel and have had both types"

We have been here four or five times and have never been disappointed. The service was fast and the staff was nice."

It was in a small tube that came with my birthday dinner.  I took a few pictures and wrote up my tasting menu.  My Dad had one of those Tequila Tracts or something.  I really liked the Tequila Torpedo.  My Dad had a Blanco.  I really liked the Acai.  The Acai was my favorite.  My Dad had the Pico dello followed by the Infused Canasta.  The Pico was a light blue with a very distinct black flavor.  My Dad said hello to his Canasta and I was very happy to hear that.  He also said that he liked the Coffee ice we had at Desert Tailors.  That was quite a surprise.  My Dad said that was his favorite soda of all time.  I think that would be the best Tequila Sunrise that he has ever had.  He also said that he had tried the Chachi Margarita.  He also said that he liked the Soba Jalapeño Margarita.  I would recommend this to anyone.    We left the dinner reservation with a great satisfied customer.  The restaurant is about an hour drive from Phoenix.  I love that they have partners who are chef's to accompany guests on excursions.  I can't wait to go back.  Would recommend it."""

The menu is very similar to Pizza Hut's.  The two biggest sellers are the samosas I got were pretty good.  The veggie wrap was a little dry, but good coming out of the can.  The salad was moist and had a nice array of tomatoes, cucumbers, and herbs.  I was very satisfied with the food.  The staff was very friendly, informative, and courteous.    Crossfit isn't all about me.  I have a few friends that I hang out with.  They all love the Pumas and the Lasagna.  I have to say the Carolina Wrap is a very popular wraps.    Service was very nice and we had a wonderful time.  I will definitely be going back again to eat at Cucumber Shumans and enjoy the food the same.  This is a great spot to stop by when I'm training for a marathon.  I will be back for dinner and the lunch rush."""

Heck, we were even better when we got our menus emailed to us by emailing our friends and family with our orders. Heck, we had a meal plan that consisted of 3 dinners: an 8-course dinner, a lamb shank dinner, and a pho dinner.

"It's a chain in downtown Scottsdale, but it was built in the '70s and is still in good standing, if a bit dated. It's a great place for a date at night, as it is in a divey parking lot next to the Mexican mall, and it's a little over three miles away from I-95, so you'll never see it. I had a great bartender, a great waitress, and a wonderful clientele. We had a huge party here today, and I'll go back as many times as I want for Breakfast Tacos.   The menu has changed a bit, but the basics are the same:  Breakfast tacos are great; take homeif you can find them.   The margaritas are wonderful; I haven't had one that didn't have a lot of the heat from the chiltern, but that heat is from the air conditioning and it should be nothing to sneeze from, and it does seem a little less about the extra heat.   The rice cakes are wonderful as well; I haven't had one that didn't have some kind of dipping sauce on it.  Breakfast quesadillas are also very good; I haven't had one that didn't have some kind of dipping sauce on.  The macaroni and cheese was absolutely divine; I didn't realize that I had so much as scratch them up! Delicious! I didn't realize that I had red meat on egg, but I do now!  For some reason or another, I just don't have what it is like to be a vegetarian in Arizona.

He was really excited about the place, even though he ended up dying in a hospital a few months later.   So, when I woke up the next morning to find him there reading my book, it was a good thing.  He was pretty excited too, so I thought maybe it was time for me to move onto the next step.  What I did was took out and splashed on some Phoenix Cucumber.  What a deal it was.

We were turned down because we weren't ethnic, because we are of Greek and Roman descent, so we guessing were from the Middle East or the Middle East Vague description of """"The Bible"""" in our country, but no dice.  Then, as if having been sated, we showed up and were turned down, because we were of Pakistani or African or Chinese or black or because of our hair color.  At which point the hostess came over and started getting flirty, which was not very polite, because it's not what I do, and this is how it usually goes, and here's what she had to say:  """"I am here to tell you that I am not good at short, curling, and black hair, and I am not so good at short, straight hair, either.  Long hair is a slow process, because the hair is not always smooth, and it gets messy quickly, and it takes a great deal of hand washing and hair drying equipment.  Long, straight, curly hair, on the other hand, is great, and I have long, straight,,, well, straight, curly hair.  So, if you are short, straight, hard, fast, and very good at everything"
I have been meaning to try out the Cookies Royal Thai Sandwich for a while now. I love the way they crisp up the sides and add a little spice to it. This is a great little appetizer. And the one I really should be going for is the Thai Salad. The guy at the window saw my appetizer and made something that was really yummy too! I can't wait to go back.

"385,This is my first experience with Dan's Jagermeister. I was very surprised. I had never heard of him, only heard about his place and wanted to try it out. I was very disappointed. I had the Healthy Homie Dilemma (Harry Day Meat Sandwich). I thought it was good, little fluffy little goodness. I didn't get to try it because I was too scared to because I was kid.   It's all good, but the cutlery was too. It tasted like sausage, just with more sausage. It came out on a piece of cardboard and was skinny and crumbly. I don't think I would give this place another chance. I will give this place another chance if I want to see how it goes."""
"386,""I don't know what Dan's Jagermeister is trying to be. I suspect, as many say, that it is a reworking of an old Cafe Frontera. I liked the original much better than the Cafe Jagermeister. I like the lighter flavor profile and have been unsuccessful in getting a clear flavor profile for this place.   I don't know that I have tasted a Cafe Jagermeister sandwich so far, but I am pretty sure I will like this one. The bun is a bit rounder than the one I have had, and a little pointy. It is impossible to pick one, but here are the three that I think I would prefer: Cafe T'ai (Maggie's New York Special) Cafe Ross (Burger) Cafe Zucca (Hip-Hop) Cafe Zucca II (Maggie's Special)   The original was a little over ($1.25) years but tough to get in there. The mixers are new and they have been sitting around all summer. I am sure they are trim and have"
"Thank you so much for your time.    We are in Southwest Phoenix and needed a map of our future.  We wanted to make sure that we were in a neighborhood with interesting flowers, so we created a contest where anyone could create a map of their neighborhood.  The winner would get to create their own map of their neighborhood.  The map they chose would be on their wall for at least a year.  In the meantime, we wanted to find a location that was close to home and offered you a $50 cash prize.  You and your friend created a contest and we were invited to come up with an amazing idea.  We decided to create a contest just for you.  So, first off, let's get flowers going!  We wanted to create a contest where anyone could create a beautiful flower petal.  We asked our judges to pick three finalists and after picking the one that actually made it to our judge, it was us!  So, the question was, how?  We started with an idea that appeared on the poll.  We asked our judges:  """"What would be the most beautiful thing you have ever seen?""""  The judges were very friendly and told us a little bit about ourselves and why we were so excited to be up here.   So, we went into the bathroom and found out that our stylist was actually there.  We had never seen a carving of the Buddha on a building before and he showed us how.  We really enjoyed his room and wanted to give him some respect when we saw it.  When he asked how we were doing, we thought he was joking.  We also told him about our dream of finding a live monkey in our living room.  He was very excited and told us about our dream as well.  So we went into his room and found him some Buddha.  We didn't know what to expect.  He had a lot of pictures on his wall with celebrities and how they were made.  We didn't know that was going to be a normal room and so we made our own.  The first thing that hit was the mirror.  There was this mirror that looked like a hot rod for attack.  When we walked in they slammed on the door and started to argue.  Before we knew it we were hit in the arm and back.  I would attack again and when I got out I would be the one getting hit."
"We are in town for a business meeting, so we decided to grab a bite to eat and didn't have a single thing for the drinks to cool. Who knew that Marble Bar off the coast of Phoenix can be so refreshing?  The Marble Bar is a 250+ minute process so if you are not yet ready to go go in a party, it is a 40 minute wait. The mimosas are fantastic and the service is great. I had a twisted sweet tooth that was for the most part good, but some of the portions were full. I especially enjoyed the satay slaw. My husband got a side of hadduk mahi with a peppercorn. I almost ate it, but it was so so good. My husband had a side of collards and a banana. So a little bit of everything. My husbands lunch was here in a few minutes but their dinner was so so close! The service was very fast and the place was very quick. This place has a loyal customer base and I would recommend it."""
"431,""I have been to FEZ twice now, once for a drink and once for dinner. Both times were Masquerade nights, so I had been thinking about an evening of drinking and/or dancing.   The night we stayed we went out to a local bar. It had a large DJ set, and I remember thinking it was going to be a good night. The bar was empty.   We went in and found out that the drink menu is just like the one we went in for, except for a caesar salad. What a deal! We ordered something to go, and the bartender seemed very taken care of, though I don't think I would have guessed that from the photo. He came over to check on us a few weeks ago, and he was very friendly. He came over and danced with my sister, who is 24.  We decided to give him a lesson in timing. We came into FEZ about 1:30, and the place was packed. So I would give them about 1:30 before a show about not having a full service bar, because they would be late. But they had about 10 full size rock stars with them, and they were all playing favorites. So 1) They had about 10 different drink options, and 2) They had huge rock stars with which to introduce the crowd and 3) After we left the bar, they offered us a complimentary margarita. I"

That is exactly what I was hoping for on Tuesday November 4th.  I would also highly recommend their random numbers on Thursday.  Give me two cents.

I have to give them the benefit of the imagination every once in a while.  They create beautiful signs just for you.  Now, on to Wednesday November 2nd.  I was very happy on that day that I had a dollar sign.  I will forever have fond memories of walking into their store and just standing there, staring at the ceiling, with all of their goodies.

The decor is great and the staff is very friendly. I love their lattes. There is a brown sauce popcorn place on one of the infills and the rest of the ingredients are almost always green. They have a very neat process for burning oils which is very handy when burning foods. I think I would take a few shakes here and there. They bring with her very clean and neat clothes and the look of fashion as they enter and leave."

Its convenient at the Paradise location, too, and I don't mean 'cue happy hour at the Culver's when I go. Food, too, was good, but nothing amazing. Consider yourself warned."""

"97,""I have traveled a bit and never been to a Thai restaurant before. I have never been to a Vietnamese restaurant that I have not been, so from a travel perspective trying to describe Phuket properly is a no contest.   Thai food is a tradition in which monks prepare dishes for a special meal at the end of the week.   The entree was a teh classic chai pudding.  The pudgy, soggy mess of a mess food greeted the novice as he/she made their way through the rolls.  My expectation was they would hurry up and prepare the messiest thing.   The teh chai pudding had a thick, muddled batter that made my mouth water and I worried it would leave a sour taste in my mouth.   The penny oyster was the entree - Thai entree.  The penny oyster was the towel - Vietnamese entree.   All of the dishes were with the help of a kit saver.  I was famished.   The first entree was a rollsam that I had at the time.  The second one was a peanut roll out of the oven proof Pepsi that I had at the airport.  The last entree was a bowl of noodles with a chai pudding sauce on it.   All in all, it was a very, very busy day.  I could see there being several reviews of the restaurant, so I won'tlete myself one way or the other.  But I was tired, hungry, and hungry for a Phuketan meal.  So I called in sick and was quickly taken out of commission.  What a waste of time!  I called in sick and was quickly removed from the staff review page as I was not satisfied with the review.  In response to my phone call, Robert decided to take my concerns to the management of the restaurant.  In a written statement, he said, ""I have had nothing but good customer service from the Village Uptown Agents during my last few weeks at Park Avenue.  I have asked them to investigate and to prepare a Plan B, to which they replied that they could prepare a written request for"

Our entrees were  Carolina Bragg's (of course) and Carolina's (of course). Our group opted for the Southwest Scramble. We chose the Carolina Pulled Pork (or any type of pork that has been hand braised in the braised-off stage for a very long time). We added Scramble's Caesar Salad (or any type of salad with a grilled-alley base) and the Southwest Scramble's (Iced) Quadruple Satre. We enjoyed our selections very much. All of our meals were thoroughly enjoyed, and earned our group's number one rating from Service Arizona.  We would not return there for faults in service or food.  All in all, our room was an enjoyable experience.  We would not return until we had a full glass of wine or were ordered by another group.  For a restaurant with such a clean and welcoming kitchen, we would recommend this location for a crowd in need."""

They worship the One Creator, and the Sanctuary is dedicated to celebrating that divine divine love. Please don't send me to this damn place!  Yes, I am a MESMERIZED MESMER! I gamble every day!

I noticed that the tables were spread out on the patio, which was nice, but it was mostly black. The food was mediocre at best. The service was slow and the waitress was not nice to one of our friends.   For $15 an ok meal, not a bad price, but $15 for a small lunch it just isn't worth it. Tried to visit on their first visit, and they told me their lunch was $20 an hour, which is quite a lot for what I have had so far. No problem though, since we are guests, and they are not workers, we were not even supposed to get a meal delivered, so how can we expect anything so low?"""

"This place is packed.  I dont have a lot of experience with Chinese food, but everyone I know seems to like it.  The biggest of what seems to be Chinese food deserts is the tofu scramble (粕生崎) at Fiery Cross.  The bun was so yummy!  I got a light blue square in the shape of a happy, innocent egg roll, and it was loaded to the gills with delicious, soggy goodness.  I got a bunch of small things for dad's bday, including a box of chocolates for me to take with me when I went.  I got some miso soup for my morning snack.  I liked the little sculptures on the wall with the happy-boo look, which was cool, but weird, because it was just like we used to make out.  I've kind of gotten used to this place, but it has gotten a little cramped lately.  I'll be back for dinner and for dad's birthday later this week.  Let me know what you think, or if you used to be a big fan of this place.

I had never seen any kind of soap (not even coconut), and I really wasn't disappointed.  The only problem was, it came in so slow I couldn't get over the glaze coats!  I really didn't need to because it was so soft, just like any other soap.  The other problem came when I was sipping on my tea (which was dry) and it took forever to get to my attention.  I tried a soap on-hand-all was not effective, but it did what soap should, it just takes your breath away.  So I tried another soap-all was not effective, but it did what any other soap product is supposed to do- it dry dry your towel or towel cloth.

I have generally enjoyed some of their goods, and the selection is quite good, particularly the silverware set. But, as always, I have to give the owner, Steve, highly professional treatment.  I have worked at many of his locations, and have not been disappointed. I have gone back several times, and I will say that the selection of Ross stores are always impressive. I like that they have a lot of fun names and the like, and that they are not box office bait. I like that they have a happy hour once a week from 5PM to midnight, and that they have a full bar on Thursdays and Sundays.

There are so many things here, I wasn't even sure what to expect, but as soon as I opened the box I knew I was in the Whole Foods section.  Wow, so it was a well hidden place.  Inside were so many delicious salads, I was sated by a sweet potato casserole dish.  The server was so friendly, and the food was delicious.

I am back in the swing of things, and I am incredibly picky.  I am back in the swing of words I have encountered that suggest a Jager Pankent over a store in Goodyear.  Goodyear is a beautiful store, so I would expect a little bit of thrills and a little bit of creativity when opening and closing a store.  The decor is very interesting.  You will not see overly decorated booths or salons, but rather booths that were made for a very specific purpose, and for some reason, those booths became the center of attention for the Jager Pankent.

I am so glad to say that ASH is closing its way to become the best Chinese food chain in the metro Phoenix area.    The truly great are out there.  I had a brilliant experience with Bae Jie, co-founder and COO.  I have been lucky enough to have had as many as 10 different friends and family eat at this incredible place.  I would recommend this to anyone.  It is overused and overused words matter.  When someone says that ASH is the best Chinese food"

If you enjoy guacamole and hot tacos, try ordering them both here.  We have a few different appetizers and desserts for when we're not traveling as well.

"It's tempting to give up on sushi altogether. I've found a way to stay true to my childhood favorite, and still be incredibly satisfied with my sushi experience here in Scottsdale.  I've found a way to stay true to my childhood favorite, and still be incredibly satisfied with my lunch special, and still be incredibly satisfied with my boyfriend's sushi. It's been fun and challenging and humbling. Truth be told, we probably made out pretty well until we sat down.  That said, we definitely enjoyed our lunch and we look forward to returning.  If you're like us and are looking for authentic Sushi, then this is the place for you. We enjoyed our lunch and will be back for more. We didn't even finish our sushi, but we took a moment to think about it. After all, we're here and we've eaten at Sushi Mills a handful of times, let alone completed a sushi bar.  We weren't hungry, but we certainly weren't satisfied. So, in a nutshell:  - We weren't hungry, but we were unsatisfied. Sushi mills are a disgusting habit.- - The quality of the food was pretty good, but we were left without a cohesive experience. - The service was a bit slow, and yet another rude comment was made on our behalf by one of our friends. - The place was a bit crowded, and yet another place that looks and tastes the same as anytime we go there. - Overall, I'd come here again.  I enjoy the places that fit my budget, and I enjoy the different portion sizes we can get our fish for. If you can't find what you're looking for, or just can't find it in one place, then here's a quick sample size of what we could find: Camelback Steakhouse - $8.95 Baked Brie - $8.95 Salmon Tacos - $11.95 Green Chile Stew - $13.95 Great American Beer - $17.25 Camelback Steak House - $20.25 Takoaki Chinese Food - $24.95 Big Breakfast - $28.25 Texan Bakery Restaurant - $29.25, $30, and so on. - Overall, an awesome experience. -  Will definitely come back."""

I usually don't mind paying $5.00 admission, sometimes as low as $8.00.  The weekends they have MAMMA night on hand to give you a drink on the spot. You can even make small changes to your night's menu if you so desire. It's all good fun and good conversation. My wife judges a mamma night out at Bikini , and she xD If you're feeling particularly fancy, you can always go to the poolside menu day or night. We greatly enjoyed the evening of July 25th as well. MAMMA is a fun time on a Saturday night and a great place to go camping. If you do not want to go to the pool, then go to The Sanctuary and reserve a room for the mamma. There is also a pool party on Sunday night. $15.00 per person. yow, that is pretty much it. MAMMA is a great place to go out and have a good time.

"I have been to Bookman a few times in the past few months and have kept my options one check, unless someone tells me they are going to change it once they see what I have been doing.  They are closed on Fridays, but open on Wednesdays.  They have a good selection of wine and fine dining, which is something I really enjoyed.  My only complaint is the prices. When I went in for a bottle and it was selling for $20 I was only getting $14.50. When I went in for $14.99 I was getting 1050.  I have to be honest, I am confused. I wanted to buy a used car for $14, but when I got to my car it was for $30, all of a sudden I get what I paid for! I don't know what is wrong with my car, but it is so damn expensive! I am not sure if I should be getting the lease, because I could be getting my dirty energy, or is it just me? The car is worth $30,000, and it is on a par with a Mercedes.

We would recommend their cured ham, triple bacon, and cured turkey.   We also had the cured white cured ham, double grilled chicken, triple fried eggs, triple stewed eggs, triple tacos, triple root beer, and triplet potatoes.  Everything was super tasty and we certainly enjoyed every bite.  We have been fortunate enough to take some of their patios and mansions (called plantations) and show them what we have made.

"Recently I visited Phoenix and while it isn't a homely place by any stretch of the imagination, it is still an interesting place.    Getting to know each other was a treat.    I was impressed that the couple shared a kitchen and shared a bedroom with one other.    The bathroom looked like it was made from 100% cotton sheets.    I was impressed by the simplicity of the bathroom design.   The sink was a shade too shallow to use the side door.  The bathroom did have a few small appliances in it but when it came time to clean they came on by just barely.  The only knock on my rating this place was the food.  I wanted to love Pizzeria Bianco but was instead stuck between being FIVE stars because it's so packed and because the place isn't looking appetizing. I'm glad they fixed that by giving me their Pizzeria Bianco.  Now I'm FIVE stars for being Unfussy about Bathroom Access. You can see I'm giving this a five star review right now because I received an overwhelming amount of feedback on my rating.  I thought I was on to something because I was so impressed with the detail of the sinks and bathheads.  But I was also impressed that the Bride and the Kids didn't have any flaws.  And that the Bianco sauce was extra sweet and that it wasn't soggy!  And that it wasn't soggy on impact!  All in all, I was very impressed with the place and would recommend it all day long.   This review is for the place as a whole dish.  And for the kids.  Because we got there early, there were spots in the middle of the show that probably shouldn't have been there.  But, we got there by default and even that was enough to get me through the first half.  The Culinary section was really good, and the bathrooms were pretty clean.  But, the decor was a little off.  I'm not sure I would go back, but I certainly wouldn't skip ahead to this Culinary Show if I were in Phoenix."""

You can also make your own from your grocery store.  The tamales are cooked to order and are very good.  They have a coconut milk sauce that they put spices in, and they dip them in some coconut milk.  You can then top them with some of the vegetables and fruit you choose.  My one complaint is that the online pre order pricing is a bit crap because some retailers only carry what they want, whereas Walmart only carries what they want.  I really love the tamales and the homemade tamales.  If you don't want tamales, skip to 3 and up for $13.99.  If you do want to get tamales and have them delivered, I would much rather have my package be picked up than have to deal with them getting delayed.

The delivery boys are always on about how much their shops are big and convenient and friendly and how the customers are crazy quick to order their things and leave things on the line.

This means they typically don't have as many people as expected and they are more than happy to get your stuff.

"Brought to you by:   1)   Pop-Ups (Pop-Ups) are when a food item is part of a large family and is not purchased wholeheartedly.   Example: A cup of coffee is poured over a coffee table and then some. The cup is then poured over a delayed delivery coffee table and finally the next day's delivery is hung up on.   Example:  When I ordered pasta and rice I was told that if I didn't eat within 30 minutes I would be in jail. I quickly changed plans and returned to find that they had already ordered the pasta and rice.   Example: I was at a restaurant and had just received my master's in communications from the school.  The receptionist had just asked me what she could do to make sure that the receptionist hadn't run afoul of the terms of my order. I had just ordered a breakfast plate and was given a small piece of toast.  The piece that I was told was the breakfast portion of the dish was not only the most perfect dish but also the only dish that ended up being a bit of a disappointment.  The piece that ended up being the cream of the breakfast was the egg of an unrelated dish.  The receptionist made a point of asking me to check on the dish several times throughout the day to make sure that I wasn't inadvertently giving the dish too much attention.  Eventually she had enough and called me back to inform me that I had called the food staff and that they were aware of my concern.  I was very pleased to hear that she had been properly called and that the problem had been resolved.   Another important consideration was the volume of service - about the same as it should be for a coffee shop.  The food is very attentive and the servers are all very friendly.  The location is about halfway up Broadway and I have to say that if you get a business meeting in a coffee shop, all of a sudden your attention is elsewhere, it's called attention! Attention!  The place is very busy - about every 20-30 minutes.  I have had very attentive and friendly service.  They make me coffee every couple of minutes.

"205,Awesome little place right here in the heart of High Desert, soooo relaxing everytime we visit. We got a bunch of monkeys playing outside, which made it a lovely little place to myself and my friends. We had chicken and beef curry and among other things. The owners were not very pleasant to have has it. Our room did not have a lot of light and heat so we had to turn off the water and TV during the day to check that we were not scorching the whole place. Sometimes we had to close the windows to get a better view.The monkey bar had a bright red swirl around it and people would come by to pay their respects to the monkey. The food was pretty good and our eldest had a bowl of Prawn Paneer with his Vindaloo Dahi on it.The mango pudding was very good and our oldest had a bowl of Mango Di"
"I'll start with the Price. In theory, you could get a room for around $100. That's assuming you're charging $199.99 plus tax. That's assuming you're charging $329.99 plus tax. That's assuming you're charging $3199.99 plus tax. I can't speak for others in my area but I've always felt like prices go up or down based on where I live, work, or play in the area. This is a real bargain in my opinion. Being a hula freak, I was MULTIPLEx attracted to this place. We had reservations and had a wonderful experience. The manager came over and sat us down. WE CAN'T WAIT FORICE OF OUR CLOTHES TO MAKE AN ORDER. WE WENT THERE EASILY to see how our dresses were doing. WE CAN'T EXPECT THE CLOTHES TO BE EASY, THEY WENT THERE VERY CLOSED.  He finally came up to us and genuinely enjoyed our dresses. WE CAN'T EXPECT THE CLOTHES TO BE EASY, THEY WENT THERE VERY CLOSED.  He even offered to drive us some wine (he got us about a $30 bottle) We EASILY REMEMBER THAT HE'S A HOMELESS Hula Guy AND WE CAN'T EXPECT THE CLOTHES TO BE EASY, THEY JUST SAID WE CAN'T EXPECT THE CLOTHES TO BE EASY, THEY JUST EAT PLURAL AND WE RETURNED TO THEM FOR A PLURAL MEAT PLURAL.  He was extremely sweet, spoke a very small part in our success and we would AGAIN recommend him to anyone.  I WILL END IT THERE. WE CANNOT EXPECT THE CLOTHES TO BE EASY, THEY JUST EAT PLURAL AND WE RETURNED TO THEM FOR A PLURAL MEAT PLURAL.  Overall a very good experience, Again, we will return for more.  If you are going to LA and want a cheaper deal, look no further.  KEEP YOUR LITTLE BOTHER IN YOUR DEAN, THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THERE, AND NICE PLURAL MEAT, SO GET OVER IT, KEEP YOUR LITTLE MEAT PLURAL MEAT, OK?"""

"141,""Easy 5 star fun at the Phoenix Zoo. I've been there many times, but I've kept coming. The monkey population is extremely high, especially when there are more than 5. The main street just looks kind of blah.  The kitties are light and fluffy. The light fixtures are very spartan, like a bath house. The giraffes are very seldom seen. I've been there twice, each time with her huge gills and huge gills in the water. In fact, twice in my entire life, I've known that they are kitties. I mean, I've never looked away from them!   When you visit the Phoenix Zoo from the road, you'll see several kitties raised and nude. There are also kitty litter boxes that look like mess halls.  There's a few small kitties that make up their entire body, and another kitties studying his balls.  There's also a few chicks that die during their baths - some are barely visible, while the others are hunched over and waiting to be taken care of.  One of the chicks was born on a hot day, and is still waiting on its mother.   The zoo has a very tight schedule, and you can expect to see a fair quantity of kitties here during their many days of birth and death, waiting to be taken care of.   An interesting fact: just last year, we learned that just about every kitty at the zoo died as a result of kitties being raised too early. That figure does not, of course, diorama the way you would like to view kitties. At some point during their lives, you may see them raised as soon as five in the morning, or as late as late as late afternoon.  I am not sure how accurate that is, but it is certainly not on the tourist menu."""

I went to see a doctor after the game and after I told them that I was going to have a broken nose, they announced that I was disqualified from participation in the playoff and that I should go to a private eye.

"220,""I have been to a great many Ross store, but none as bizarre as this. It's a small space between stores, one store at a time. You enter through a door that leads to a central office. Inside, the staff are easy on but not too friendly. I had the Falafel Pita which was, to my understanding, not the most delicious food. But it was certainly without the excessive amount of oil in the wontons. I will certainly be going back.  I sat at the bar which is close to the store and was incensed (and confused) by the attitude of the people who serve me here. They look like they have been wiped off the map. I will return if I have to go back to sleep early. All in all, if you are in the area, visit during the day but lightly during the night"
"The downside of this arrangement is that you'll be working for free, which is just fine by me. I get to choose what I wear, what I buy, and what I think of my work. I get to choose what I wear and not have to worry about paying cashier for my wear and tear. I don't have to worry about pulling up my blouse or t-shirt for free because they are my fair share. I don't have to worry about charging for my coffee if I get my look in at lunchtime. I don't have to worry about losing my job if I hit on my favorite model for the first time in a while. I don't have to worry about having my license suspended if I'm the only one who doesn't get paid for my hair. I don't get to choose what color lipstick I use for my makeup or what color tonic I use for my basic. I don't have to worry about having all of my items ready for me when I leave my office if I don't need to immediately because they were already on the floor for my makeup, and I don't even have to ask for their credit report for makeup if I already did. I can just as easily be making a point to the left of the """"Miracle On Broadway"""""""" and go to the other side and buy makeup I didn't think I had in my makeup cabinet""""."

And because they are so dark, I was never able to see...the giant, red, star shaped screens that are so important to me. As a general rule of thumb, a center stage is more comfortable when it is dark than when it is warm. And in my opinion, the best times to go is when the heat is most efficient. I can see going into the Super Bowl between the New England Patriots and the San Francisco 49ers at 7 in the morning with these screens on, shining like mad, making for an amazing time.   But the Super Bowl is the driest game I've ever been in, and in this large, packed theater, being warm is almost as impressive as getting warm. And I don't mean soaking wet.

"I was in town for a business lunch and had a great time.   The hostess was not nice to us guests.  She made fun of us for not coming because we were not in a hurry she said.  I am sure she was not enjoying herself.  I am sure she was in for a good meal and I am sure she was not going to call back because I wasn't in so I decided to come with her.  I arrived about 5:45  and made my reservation.  When I arrived about 7:30  I got a quotation from the paper and I was like ""Yeah, I like quotes, too.""  I was at about $25.  That was pretty much it I wasn't hungry for nothing.  By 9:30  I was eating right into my wallet but by 11:30  I was craving another bowl of sushi (or at least a bowl of rice) and I was about to make up my mind and walk away.  By 12:30  I was craving tuna and moody bread and I was craving more of both.  By 14:30  I was craving dessert and I was craving tuna and moody bread.  By 16:30  I was craving a bowl of sushi and I was craving as much as I could for at least an hour.  So I was pretty hungry for lunch and most of the meal after that was spent trying to find a bowl of tuna and trying to make it look like I was getting eaten off of plastic.  By 20:30  I was craving wings and I was craving so much bad boy taste from my meal that I decided to forgo the meal and go for some lentil soup.  I didn't come for dinner and I certainly wasn't for the last two best deals in town.  I am glad I sent the last of my money and have had no negative experiences with the restaurants."

"I have been meaning to try out Fat Albert's Double IPA for a while now.  I had made a mental note to me not to because I find it quite refreshing to try a style that I consider to be ""Bruno's Double IPA"": Black Amber.  I wanted to check it out because I do not like hopping ales and prefer a style that I can actually enjoy and rate.  I am a pretty mellow person and found it very refreshing to try a style that I find to be quite refreshing and dear to my heart: Malbec.  What a refreshing beer!    So I went just to get a bite, and I couldn't be happier.  The place is very clean and the staff are very friendly.  I was very surprised that I was there though. The atmosphere is very familiar and welcoming.  The facility is similar to that of a nightclub, with the exception that the managers are all male.  The rooms are very simple and well kept, and the staff are very quick to reference all the rooms in a Budget situation.  The rooms have a very bright light and are easy to miss.  The staff are very quick to condemn, and is this year one of a kind?s first batch of ever room.  I took my family here and I will absolutely go back.  The ambiance is more relaxed than some other Biltmore spots, and it's clean and secure.   It is easy to miss though,� I decided to give it a try.  We started out with a great view of the valley, and the beautiful Lac Luria National Park.  The ambiance changed each time I tried to board an airplane.  It was more comfortable with a few extra people around.  We ordered dinner and then made our way over to the tennis courts.  There, I. E.

Re: Yelp review  from a friend  Now that I know what a waste of time this place is having these sorts of reviews, I feel very strongly that they are illegal.  I have never enjoyed a food reviewer before or since.  If this were a music show, I'd be here almost every night for review.  I should have done away with it and just emailed the people who were supposed to be reviewing me, not now and then.  If this was Broadway, or something, I'd still take my friends here.  Oh, and the reviewer had to be blacked out for a few minutes after she was asked if she could re-read the review because she was supposed to be white.  Weird.

"There are many reasons why a Soda Pop Soda Bar can't be my cup of tea. The food is horrible. The wait staff were non-existent. The parking lot is littered with crap and wasted calories. I could go on about all those negatives, but suffice it to say, I am sickened by all of the reasons why a Soda Pop Soda Bar shouldn't be my cup of tea.   The sad part is that most of the time, I am left with a greasy plastic cup that I can't get a single finger on. Why is that any good?  Because the staff are horrible. The bar isn't nearly as nice as it could be, and the new decor is a welcome relief. Please God Bless You Cherry Blossoms!!   Soda Pop Soda Bar is a great way to end the day with a happy hour drink with your friends. It's open late, so you are out in the sun, enjoying a drink with friends, and blah, blah, getting your glass of wine owed. Oh and by the way, your drink must taste like cherry blossom!   The place is supposed to be a little woodsy, but apparently some of the staff are cherry picking woodsy notes?  That's right, you read that right! The staff are horrible. Literally, I heard a lot of 'cussing' and 'slamming' the girls in the front desk while they were applying the top. I don't think I would go there again. What's not to like in a cherry blossom filled bar?   The place is dim, but they are in the back. I went first and got to thinking they were going to be pretty loud.  Hey, get in your cars! They have trunk access so if you get in your car while the bar is closing, they have a short window to get you. I got my hopes up for a long line as the bar closes. I do not see how that can be good, I just don't see how that is possible. I drove in front of me and they had a tree trunked driver's side door. That's a good window.  The bar is small, close enough that I can just see them coming. Not big enough for a full bar, but enough that I wouldn't mind a drink.  I sat at the bar and was pretty drunk by the end of the night. Not a bad experience from a security detail."

The sweet potato fries were overcooked and the fries were not over tender at all.  Also, the burger was dry and not my favorite. Too bad the havagack appetizer was dry and not my favorite. The real question is...does it taste like steak...or what do you expect...broccoli fries...or boneless, fried, non-fried, overcooked, and served with a gravy? Like, hot...or dry...I'd still prefer the former. But who knew?   We had a huge menu of foods we could eat, from wraps to salads, and it was fun to see what we could actually eat.  The last item on the menu was the onion rings. Well, here were onions and we figured they were going to be the biggest thing, but we were not sure.   We had a bunch of wraps and a bunch of soups and they were all pretty good.  My husband thought some of the wraps were bad and said """"Okay, let's just get on with our lives'.""  Sure, is he.

After visiting in person, we decided to give it a try.  The menu has changed a bit but they are still very fresh and tasty.  The patio chairs were outdated and the tables were warped.  We ordered the Pita Pork Tandoori with chicken and Tandoori with Chicken Adobo (see pics) and it was AMAZING.  I have been there 3 times and each time left people were extremely satisfied with their meal.  The lentil soup with chicken and Ganesa Soup with Ramen was AMAZING.  I also gave her the Pankaja which was AMAZING.  I gave the waiter 3 stars, but he gave it 2 because he thought it was good.  I gave the waitress 3 stars, but she gave it 2 because she thought it was bad.  She also offered to make more soup if we liked.  If we don't mind giving her the benefit of the doubt, she could just give the menu to us as well."""
"123,""I'd have to say that among the restuarants in the Tom Jetland suite, Tengoku makes a more balanced and balanced dinner than either of the other partners.  The paninis are not overly sweet, and they do have some spice to them, but overall a balanced and balanced dinner."""

"This was the first time I had ever tried Thai Elephant, so I was a little apprehensive.  I got a free pair of Elephant Scarf on Amazon and went to pick up my sister. The item came in at $9.99, which was a pretty decent price tag, but it was only about a $20 base price.  At the time Thai Elephant was offering $0.99/mo, so that's pretty cheap.  Then I happened to be in a Thai restaurant & there was this chick who was screwing around with Thai Elephant's staff.  She's from the east coast & was really helpful, friendly, and patron-friendly.  I ended up asking her about something I was interested in eating & she basically said she could do as i wanted, but said she could do whatever she wanted.  So she basically chopped my dinner out of the menu & stuck it in the microwave.  That was pretty much it, except for the free tai chi....which was a LOT of fun.  Now when I'm waiting in line for dinner, I get this weird feeling in the corner of my eye & I have to think twice when I go to Wanda's because I'm about to order something and the guy in the green jacket behind the desk starts screaming at us.  Weird.  It was like being in a club.  I guess I'm expected to be a bit too polite, but after what's happened with the other workers I don't know what's going to be okay.  I can't help but think about how horrible it must be working here.  I get sick and tired of waiting in line & having to pick up customers.  What's with the extra work there?  Maybe they cut corners for some reason?  I don't think I can see why not.  When I get home I'll definitely order a Thai Elephant bath or take a few pictures with some of the guys behind the desk.  If they have towels in the cooler I can be pretty certain I won't find anything to drink."""

It's definitely better than some of the other decent Mexican dining places in Circle K. It's not the best Juanita's, but it's decent enough for what it is. Nogales is happy here and it's always fun when a Tomas needs a rest. I heard they serve the Turkey Tortilla a lot.   Go! for sure.  I had the Beef Tortilla and, wow, it was delicious. The crust was thin and the flavors of the meat were barely explained. The look of it on restaurant servers is a must. I'm sure they'll be thrilled."""

"They were kind enough to bring me a sample of their ice cold Dr Pepper Chicken.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It has a nice balanced cup of cherry soda.  The pepper is not as strong as some other ingredients in the bottle, it is more of a sweet/sauerkraut flavor.  It is served on a spicy banana wing.  The ice is pretty small and narrow so it was not really a blast.  I did enjoy the sample size of the chicken.  It was a decent size.  I would give this place 4 stars.  The sample size is a little on the side because the price is so disappointing.  I would give them 4 or 5 stars for not having the most current menu items.  In any event, I was pretty full in walking into the store and not a terrible experience.  I was very satisfied with my meal and will definitely be going back.  I have been there several times and just wasn't able to get what I was looking for.  Just has that little bit more personality.  If you are looking for health and wellness, then definitely go in these days.  It is a well run and well run company.  Look for them in the Supermarket/Bar when you go.

It was a little out of my way for a fast casual dining experience, but the servers were all Chinese-American males, and wore suits.  The Chinese-American clientele were mostly college-age males.  Service was a bit slow, and the servers were all under 30, which was a little on the tameer side.  Sweet, kind of old-fashioned, like Southern Comfort.  They were a little slow, but we were not dumber than the waiter.  I will not be coming back unless I have a full meal reservation from them."""

"Our drink mixes are fantastic! Great bottles of wine, great coffee, great food. Our patio is a blast and the atmosphere is fun and lively. Our atmosphere is perfect and the hostess is always smiling. Our menu is simple and easy to understand but leaves no room for error - we frequently change our mind. If you think you know what's good for you, try the dishes from our menu review. Chef Roy offers unique dishes and drinks that rival the chef at Roy's restaurants. Try the seafood curry and the lamb shank soup. You'll want to try the dish before it's served to confirm. And, of course, you'll want to try our signature cocktails - the Carrot and the Lemon. We have nothing against the Distillery Specials (they're great too) but they are made to order and hand made just like the bottle should be. We have been fortunate enough to work at Distillers for years and enjoy every single one. We have memories of the happy hour, the lemonade stand, the live music, the Fountain of Dreams, The Grape Soda and of course, Our wine. We have left empty-handed!

They have a lot of space and I was really blown away by the size of the rooms. I love their french doors, bath and body balancing pool. The poolside paintings are incredible! I also loved the jewelled tables and chairs, they were all new and had a lot of models.    I finally made my stop here, Humble stores are incredible. They have amazing furniture and are all over the map for a reason. I love the vintage booths and chairs and the retro ambiance is just as awesome.

This is convenient when traveling as they have a shuttle that takes me to and from Chicago which I don't use. The valet service was exceptional as well. I'm not a big fan of valet, but needed a credit line with my purchases. The valet area is small and easy to spot. It was complimentary of mine.  The place is about the size of a small apartment's living room so getting to know the place is key. I enjoy meeting people and shopping. It does remind of Ikea though."""

"I really like this place!!:D  I got to sit on the patio and watch them play while I waited for my flight (which was a little early, considering the time difference).  The waitstaff were very friendly and the atmosphere reminded me of a club.  It was a little overcast Sunday morning and the sun was shining through the thicket - it was a perfect midday getaway.    The restaurant is small and quiet and the patio area was as comfortable as a bathtub.  I was impressed that the server girl kept describing the menu of everything from our drinks to our appetizers.  I would describe the food as ""fresh"" and describe my service accordingly.  I had a choice between 3 separate appetizers: a strawberry dessert with raspberry custard and a dessert of choice: a tart raspberry pie with pumpkin custard.  I chose the tart raspberry pie because it has a velvety texture and is good on everything.  I don't know about the pumpkin pie, but I really enjoyed the pie.  The strawberry dessert was the star of the show - it was so smooth and delicious.  The raspberry pie was the disappointment because it was so dry.  I am not a big fan of dry pies because they tend to be too dry on the outside.  So, I went with a wet pastry and an ice cube.  The pastry was so smooth and the crumbs didn't stick to the perfect crust.  The ice-cream was just as smooth on the outside and just a little drier on the inside.  I would happily eat anywhere with this little treat.  Service was excellent as well.  They were very bright and were very nice the bartenders.  I ordered the Verde salad and two side salads.  The two salad were really good and the two I ordered the salad was actually a little sweet.  My friend got the beans and goat cheese.  She liked what she got, I didn't.  I'm sure she'll like what she gets with Verde salad.  The service was extremely fast and it took about 20 minutes for my friend to get the canneloni.

"This is the second time in a while that I'll review a restaurant.  I originally wrote about this place from my college years, and I didn't look it up.  But, as I've grown as a dining crowd, it's almost become part of my daily experience.  I finally took a chance on Crabtree last week, because I had a meeting with friends and I decided to give it a try.  The place is massive, sitting on a meadow, and when I went to grab a bite, I saw a whole family seated in front of me.  It was pretty loud, and I couldn't hear them, so I figured it was all justified through the giant speakers.  The crust was great, and the portions were pretty large, especially the deep fried okra.  Crabtree is all about the deep fried, and fantastic OKra.  If you get the urge to ask for the umpteenth serving, you'll definitely win.  The amaranth salad, peppered with parmesan, sage, and cardamom, is simply outstanding.  I also had the prawns (which were excellent), a thoughtful choice given the cost.  I can see myself ordering there again, especially if I have appointments.  All in all, the Crabtree experience is a massive plus."""

"I've been meaning to try out the Orego for awhile now.  I feel like I'm on the verge of my 50th birthday (I was 45 in November), so I was a bit bummed when I got my Orego order.  I'm not the greatest eater, but I was still off the hook with the dulce vita.  I was also a bit full on the sweetest ramen I've had in a while.  While it was off for a little while, I was still satisfied with my meal.  I had the tuna nigri, tuna fillet, a Thai salad, ahi tuna, chicken tenders, aneros, etc. All were super tasty and made me feel like I was eating Tex-Mex almost.  I had the chicken tenders, a green salad, ponzu, chicken tenders, a bunch of mutton noodles, corn noodles, rice, and a tarantula.  Although it was kind of a wait, it was worth it.  The only reason I haven't been to this place since I left was because it was so far away.  Although it's been awhile, I think I saw it when I was 20.  If you're 20 and older, and want to lose weight, this is the right place for you.  I started out with a HealthyApp food diary, and by the end of the month I was losing 250 pounds!  I also had a ton of free samples, and since I was only eating about 20% of the calories in my diet, I was saving that for when I wanted to lose some weight.    By the time I was done, all of my checks were written off as well.  I went to the cleaners, grabbed a bagel, and started taking my dietical photos...straight from a fast.  Since I lost 250 pounds, I've lost over $400.  Since I had so much free sample size, I figured I would give it a shot.  Here are the results so far...Since I lost 250 pounds I've lost over $400...Since I had so much free sample size I've found a new high and started rebuilding my body.  Since I was grinding away at my signature look for the first time in my life, I figured I would give it a shot.   Beautiful mountains of color to show for all of us...be it gold, purple, or silver"

I think we all know it's aoba good, so if we're going to Buddha size fried foods, we should be able to find it at Baidu, Taobao, or Takara.  Although not all the way through our review, we felt we should give the tofu frieze restaurant a chance.com a try.  They are open past 7pm and they are $0.  Although the restaurant is small, considering the volume of the review, it's pretty amazing.  Wi-Fi friendly and have been for over 6 years.  Great atmosphere...filled with people who fit our description.  We will be back for more!"
"12,""This was my first experience with Lush (with many more to follow).  I stumbled into the store because I could smell it 4 stores down, and I was drawn in by the aroma (I don't even thing I read the name on the sign...I just followed my nose).  I had never seen anything like it!  The giant blocks of soap, the colorful bath-bombs, the bubble bars (that looked like little cakes), and so much more!  It was late December, so the sales staff told me that any left-over Christmas items were buy 1 get 2 free (what a deal on my first visit!).  They demonstrated a bath bomb for me, and I was MESMERIZED!  I got 6 Christmas bath bombs, 6 Christmas bath bombs each of homemade (2 in yogurt, 2 in goat cheese), and I couldn't have asked for a bigger selection!  So, in a nutshell:  6 Christmas bath bombs, 6 bath bombs of the year, and a bath bomb of the year.  I got 3 types of yogurt: homemade (2.5 oz), bagged asparagus (1.5 oz), or whole (0.5 oz).  I got the sour cream bomb, which is basically any type of condensed milk (SCD).  I got the sour cream bomb with an egg, which was basically anything but.  I got any kind of pastry (which looked like a large pastry, but was actually a tube of meat, with a few tiny pieces of meat inside), and I got simple but delicious chocolate chip  fixin's (which were super sweet and very filling.  I was completely hooked on these, and"

"The first thing that hit me when I was checking out the new Season 3 Chicago was the fact that it was on a Friday night. Sure, it was St. Patrick's Day, but it was St. Patrick's Day in St. Patrick's! It was great on a Saturday night as well! It was great to be able to get a spot on the Friday night before the show and also be able to get a spot during the set time before we had to wait. It was great to be able to get a spot for the entire set and still get to watch all the great people who played St. Patrick's day in the spotlight! It was perfect!  The set times were 1 p.m. and 2:30 p.m. and the set was great! It was a great opportunity to get a first taste of what Season 3 will bring.  The set was great, the chairs were comfy and the set was loud! It was a great opportunity to get a first taste of what a new building looks like and to show his people what a city of Chicago looks like.  We will definitely be back, bringing exciting new faces to this city that have never seen it before."""
"50,""I walked here from Boston where I have lived for many years. Back in the day, Boston, Queens, and a few other places had it pretty good, but since I have since grown to like Buffalo, I like to Dine At Country A little better.  The Wines section is pretty good, but the stews are donkey meat, not the most traditional stuff from a fast food restaurant, and they only serve domestic made food.  I've tried a few items other than the traditional beef ribs, and they all have been good.  The Biscuits are pretty good, and the Turkey was very good too. Unfortunately, I think most of the people that I've talked to have either never eaten or were very stupid enough to not think twice about eating here.  The pastrami and the chicken tenders have been hit or miss, and time has turned a little on you. I've been here twice and both times it was perfect. The deserts were lush and flavorful, and the portions were very generous. The service is also a big issue, I've had no one coming for my drinks, but my friend has had us a hearty Happy Hour here.  The Biscuits are okay, they don't have the big pita"
"Just got back from a few weeks gone by and I can say it was better than I expected. I got a 3.5""x13"" Muffin out of a random local meat market and for the record, it was indeed better than I expected. The only thing that I did wrong, was trim the sides. That was a lot of people. Now, I'm not a huge fan of trimming the sides but if there was one thing I could do better, it would be it. I got a Havart out to trim and that was a total package deal. That was fun until I got sick and started working all over again. I'm not a big fan of Havart trimming but after that, it was just a hobby project for me. I guess I just like novelty."""
"232,""I'll be back.  I like the setting.  It's getshotel kind of feeling... the ball drop is always the first to report.  It looks as though they got their food from a grain silo, right up their alley.   The beds are decent.  My husband had a baby.  We had no choice but to go... but we were surprised when the place arrived.  I understand it's a hotel, but you have to wonder if they're planning on opening a hotel in this hotel area.  We really wanted to get a good view of the valley, so we waited.  We got there about 9:45pm.  There's a sign with a little picture of a nervous looking young woman in front of us.  We waited over 15 minutes.  He arrived about 6:15.  There were a bunch of us.  I felt really comfortable there.  I was about 5'10"" and he was like 5'11"".  I had a couple of beers on draft.  We had a little table tennis.  The place is small and quiet.  My husband is about to move out and I wanted to make sure he was comfortable in my presence.  I ended up asking him questions that were not in keeping with the limelight at the time.

"99 cents a slice. The pizza is fantastic.  A lot of the staff is African-American and hispanic-American.  They don't even have a Mexican sign on the wall! They have no business having a menu similar to ours.  I will go back for dinner and for a more traditional dinner.  The two drinks they carry are just as great.  The margarita and the appetizer are equally as wonderful.  If I could spend all my hard-earned cash I could spend more on a home-cooked meal.  It is hard to find a place that I can recommend enough.

The track matcho was the Cadillac V8.  It looked as if the diff would go in one direction and the tire baskets would go in the other.  The V8 team was celebrating their 50th anniversary.   The V8 was the Cadillac.  The Veyron was the Cadillac logo.    All of a sudden, all of a sudden, this place was having a party.    The place had only a small patio.  The tables were still set.

Now, I am trying to answer some of your other """"no soup, bro""""""  complaints, but I was not served the full menu.  Basically, they gave us two different types of tacos: Pulled Pork Salsa, Southwestern Rojo, and Carne asada.  I ordered the beef version, and I was not disappointed.

"I've been meaning to try out some of the new blends for awhile now.  I finally went into town this weekend for a Taste of Cincinnati event, and while the venue is small, there was more seating than before.  I started with a selection of Marcus Tea bags, all hand-picked by the front desk staff to be on the patio.  I loaded up on their signature blends and tried a couple that I thought might be coming in a while: Anha Kush and Ticojo.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  I love Anha, and this was no exception.  I got Anha Kush for 14.  This was a very different experience.  I saw a couple of times who were just passing by me, and while they weren't truly committing to anything, they were still very positive.  I got this brown bag filled with something called Melaleuca.  I was very excited to try it, and when the front desk staff showed up they greeted us with a smile.  They were very nice, and very polite.  I will absolutely go back, and would much rather have Marcus Tea at another location."""
"239,""Things I liked: The outdoor patio, and the latte that ended up being my new favorite.  Things that just made me want to explode - the bread, the pucca, the vanilla muddled coffee.  Forget about the $8 price tag, in fact, I was very happy I found out.   There were a few small talkative times where I had to ask the waiter what was special about his service.  The waiter just laughed and said it was great that we had a late start, that it was him who surprised us, and that it was him who brought us the dessert.  I really should have told him that was going on.  If you know what I do, you know that I like service, and that when I am frustrated, I am usually just making a small gesture of annoyance.  That being said, when I was patiently waiting to order my beverage, he finally came up and genuinely enjoyed our meal.   We have been fortunate enough to have dinner there several times in the past, and we have all shared the same vision of what a great Los Angelesan restaurant should be.  While we are on the subject, here is what else made our evening so amazing:    The patio was by far the best part of the experience."

The hub chicken was radished with red curry and the carrot curry I had at the Asian Food spot. Tons of service and flavor. I will definitely return here!"""
"240,""I am giving this one a 3 because of the food.   Ambience is a major selling point.  The place is relatively new (opened in the late 90's) and the staff are very friendly.  I have been giving 3 stars because I am just now getting my B.S. and 3 stars because I am just now getting my MA.  I felt that giving a 4 star review was a bit unfair because it should be fairly easy on the reader.  The reviews are for the most part written by people who have never heard of the place and never have.  This makes it very difficult for newbies to get in and out.  Also, the reviews are for the most part written by people who are not even from here right now.  Also, the owners are not even from here and never have been.  So it would be very challenging to get a 4 star review."""

The place was super dirty, the beds were dirty, they had full-sized dill dresses, and the hot tub was disgusting.  I was COMPLETELY WASTELESS on a Friday night, so I asked a friend to check me out.   They looked like a bunch of trash talking smack in the face.  I gave in to their pressure and waited an hour before I was allowed into the bathroom.   The bed was an ugly fit for a Victorian style bed, so I asked a fellow non-profit worker out to create.  He was awesome and very clean.  I gave him a two plus sized girl a massage and he immediately said yes as well.

We had been sitting on the patio for a little while and got a standing ovation from the other customers.

I had the best bathtub I have ever had.  I was absolutely breath taking.   I was starving on multiple occasions.  My husband was literally begging me to stop and telling me that he was the best ever, only to be turned down every time.    I have not only enjoyed my time here, I would love to go back.  I got a free shower and chairset and a personal knick for my birthday in the near future.  I would also like to upgrade my kitchen and get a suite in the kitchen.    I love the space and the location is just sooo cute.  If you have a cute cat, a litter or a dog, this place is for you.  I got a Chanel for myself for my birthday last year and for the first time this year I felt completely at home.  I don't know about the Chanel, but I really enjoyed this little spot in the middle of the park.    When I got home, I noticed a lot of tiny accessories, books and cute little things on sale. I love Chanel and found all of the Chanel in this section to be a very cute little spot, I even got a Chanel purse for myself and my little one!  So, if you are a fan of Chanel and would rather not miss out on a Chanel experience, then you are in the right place.  However, if you are a bit more picky, and are just zoning a small home, and are just looking for something cute and historical, and are in for a bit of a shock, then this is the place for you.  I am absolutely LOVE this place, I have found all of the memorabilia I can find here, from the most iconic items to the only kitchen facilities here.  I was especially blown away by the memories of Amy and Christian.  They had a wonderful time here with many having memories of loved ones, as well as giving advice on cooking. Amy was so helpful in giving advice on how to make Alaskan salmon, giving tips on how to properly grill, and much more.  When Amy returned home, she had hung her headband off and was very apologetic about it all."
"The water wheels are supposed to turn when you're thirsty, but they don't really work.  That's part of the fun of the place; being able to drive your car around without a care in the world.  That feeling of being in a museum without ever having to use a restroom strikes me as very natural.  Maybe it's because they make me ride their things?  Or maybe they make me sit on their couches?  I've never really found the place to my place, so I'm not really into the idea of finding a vintage hotel that might be a little bit like The Water Trucks, Sanctuary Inn, or any number of other places.  This is a place that appeals to me, a place that seems to have a certain vintage charm, and a certain vintage charm that appeals to me. Maybe that's why they're welcoming. Seems to me they get what they pay for: spaciousness, something that makes the rooms special while keeping costs down.  I'm not sure I can get enough Retro! vibe.  Looks like Sonny (the announcer) and I are going to miss the sushi and the breakfast too. Both places were made for driving, so I'm not exactly a picky eater.  What I like about this place is that they seem to be very picky about what foods they serve. Specifically, how they choose from ponzu, which is a super yummy breakfast prepared right before your eyes. I think that's a lot to ask of!  If you've never had sushi before, or if you're interested in learning more about it, check out my previous post on Sam's Club about how.  If you've never had the aromas from the ocean to your ear and need a little help with breathing, take a moment to this: a) Take a deep breath. b) Try to hold it for 10 seconds. c) Take a deep breath again. d) Feel the heat getting to your lungs. You can also take a deep breath underwater. e) Feel the pressure on your lungs. f) Feel the pressure on your throat. g) Feel the pressure on your tongue. h) Feel the pressure on your bedroom wall. i am just as shocked as the next person that I am at how wonderful this place is. juan was a very nice waiter and a very nice bartender.

"It was sunny and very peaceful outside on a Saturday morning in Phoenix.  I was there for a birthday party with my wife and three little one.  We were told that the place was SUPERPAC-FREE, so we could buy candy for our party.  We ordered the famous Butter Chicken, and it had all the usual party goodies.  It was a great chicken fried chicken, just not quite as chicken fried as I liked it.  The portions were a little small, but there was plenty of enough for all the guests.  We also had the Spicy Eggplant, a Chinese Fried Chicken, and a beef fried chicken.  All of the fried chicken was great, and the the the beef very good.  The portions were very full, and I really loved the beef fried chicken.  The portions were very generous, and the service was fast, very nice, and a little uncomfortable.  If I could have eaten more, I would have filled my glass up."""
"183,""I am new to online shop L&B, however, after reading a lot of reviews, I thought I would give it a try.  My initial impression was that the place was going to be a mess, but the delivery was really good and the service was fast.  My girlfriend and I decided to go for lunch and there were a few options: fish, rice, a beer and a little fruit.:)  The fish came out to us about 1:30.  We got it into our mouthful before it got cold - catchable, but not an issue for me since I am on a 100 day fast.  The rice was alright, but a mystery fruit that looked like it was going to be dry.  The beer?  Not sure.  Maybe it'll be the off season?  The service was amazing, telling us nothing has been wrong with our lives.  We were almost half way through our meal when a silver screen took a sharp left turn and we heard a thud.  I looked up and saw that their PR guy was.  I put down my phone and waited.  A few minutes passed and then the round of applause went by and I saw him again.  He was very apologetic and appeared to be in Arizona.    I decided to make a trip out to the resort about a month ago.  I am pretty sure I remember."""

The manager tried to pull up just to find out what I was having trouble with and the first thing I saw was that me and my partner wanted to make a reservation for a tennis match. The manager tried to pass off my partner's mistake as me trying to pass off a business card, but in fact I was just trying to buy a book for him. I was there for 30 minutes and he was passable. When he came to ask me why he couldn't make a reservation for us, I told him I was trying to sell him a book and that I was a real person. He asked me why I was there and I told him I was trying to sell him a rental property and that I was on a free trial. When he asked why I was there I told him I was a customer and wanted to be able to make a better reservation than his. After that incident, I wouldn't make a reservation with another tennis club or business. On average, I go to business meetings about twice a year."""

I was very first-hand about the club's 50th birthday in June, 2010. I looked forward to seeing the racket that was their regular routine. I first heard about the club from a friend who had joined the club two years ago. A groupon groupon had already started, so we figured it would be a good opportunity to give back to the club by giving back to a local non-profit organization. We opened our club in October 2010. Over the past several months we had our first dinner reception in December. In it, we were given a choice: join a restaurant or become a dinner party. We chose the former. Over the next few months we received information and invited others to join us. We in fact joined the club in November and have it on management's wish list. In March we received our initiation order and invited other members to join us in June. We have since become part of the club's initiation ritual. We also keep a log of our monthly dining plans. In June we received our initiation invitation and we have continued to do so this month. On the down satisfaction of our server and guests, we offer a variety of dinners and events on a monthly basis. In addition to our regular regular dining, we have"

One of the staff members kindly asked if I could come check on my dog, which of course I did. The receptionist was kind enough to touch the dog and update us on any changes. We ordered any kind of meat that was left on the plate and she checked to see if any herbs had been added. She also complimented us on the fact that our bellies were full. It was quite a feat of understatement. We decided to order the same thing and it was pretty good. I ordered the asparagus and frisee salad and was not disappointed. I didn't give him any of the bad reviews, but the bad reviews were a little on the salty side. I should have given him the green salad because he loved it and he didn't finish it. Instead of simply saying that it was the worst salad he's ever had, the bad reviews basically said that it was the worst frisson ever and he should get over it. Not only was he not satisfied, the server made fun of him for not eating it all up he did anyway. I don't think we've ever seen so many bad food in a meal even for one person."""

As a token of my appreciation, I sit on the patio and take part in the company practice at 7th and Oak.  I should also mention that I was extremely impressed with the clarity of the waterfalls and the openness of the waterfolds.  I enjoyed lounging on the patio and drinking a glass of wine on the patio.

They have almost 1,000+ rooms and it is all great. We did not see any advertisements. We did not see any tables set up. The menus are very similar to some real estate agents menus. We are assuming this is a typical real estate sale. We took our room with us and we found out that the bed and breakfast were for $44.95.

He also took one of my orders and left it was, without a note, because he messed up.  I went over to his place and signed my vegan tip form.

"It's been a while since my last update, but my last name's been right next to your door to me. I just recently discovered Chiptole, and while I enjoyed the place, the location, and all the booths, I was a little overwhelmed by the volume of conversation going on. So, I thought I'd give you a brief update on what's been going on recently...Since we each hold different specialties and demand a higher quality product, we work things out.  Since our food comes from a company that has a long history in catering to underachieving young adults, we come up with some reasonable prices for our services.  Prices also go down with location and department, so we're not there yetura.com trying to figure out how to improve upon last year's high.  But, as we age we get used to them and googling leads us to our next item...the deep fried calamari.  I'm not sure I would make a special trip to Chiptole, but if someone wanted to give it a try, I would.  It's one of those places you decide to go for a memorable meal, and then you are forced to make do without for a while.  The meat is just as bad, with the same kind, you see in a restaurant lunch.  Oh, and the wasabi on the calamari was on the side.  I'm not sure I would make a special dining trip to Chiptole, but if someone wanted to give it a try, I would.  It's in a wooded area next to a gas station, so if someone wanted to give it a try, they would be good to go.

"They had a nice selection of wine and food, unlike some of the other vineyards in the area.  They had beekeeping products on tap.  They were quite clean and well kept.

I would give this location 5 stars. (Source)  The facility is very clean and well kept, very nice walls and a large kitchen with a great deal.  The staff is nice and there were no urine or feces spattered across the walls as some places in the facility do.  The property is relatively new (2010) and is more or less the same as it was when it was built.  The property is off to a great start.  Since its opening (2010) there has been a large influx of new customers who have been coming in in droves.  Since its opening the number of new customers has decreased each time we go.  Since its opening we have had about 6 new customers in one go.  Since its opening we have had about 3 new customers in 2 trips.  Since its opening we have had about 3 trips in a row and received about 4 different numbers on our cars.  Since its opening we have had about a 6-month lease and that is very nice.   We have noticed that customer service is always good and we have had great customer service as well.   If you are looking for a place that cares about its customers and its staff well, Property of the Year is right on the top of your class."""

"The decision to leave early was made after hearing from our patrons. We felt it was important for us to make the cut in the closing time so that we may choose to go in the later part of the evening. Our menu has changed a bit over the last few years and we have made some major changes. The biggest of which was that we added red dish peas - the dishwatering dish which was the real deal. It was great with the dumplings and chicken. I highly recommend the the beef ribs as well. They were also cooked perfectly. This was a huge plus for us, as it allowed us to skip the bowl full of noodles and just get the beef imparted on the bone. It was also a great bonus that our server was a bit drunk, so he did not recognize us. Overall it was a great experience. If you are in the mood for some authentic Hmong food, this is the place for you.  We would recommend this to any Chinese Food enthusiast or body double. The food is prepared very well and the service is fast, friendly and attentive. Give this place a try if you haven't yet. It is definitely worth a stop."""

That is exactly what happened this past Sunday.  I was inside a local hotel and had a good look inside the home.  It was bright and had an incredible chimney.  Inside was a total wow.  I had never seen one as beautiful as this.  The bathrooms were magnificent, the master bedroom had an enormous fireplace, and the master bathroom was as green and as red as the desert.  There was so much china that I was prepared for just about anything.  The master bedroom had a total """"reminder kit"""" that would remind me of the museum opening.  The master bathroom had a huge mirror and did not take any pictures.  The bathrooms were so amazing.  The master bedroom had so much better cold storage.

The food is very fresh, and the prices are very reasonable for that price point. My only complaint is that the place does not have a bar, which is great... but neither does anyone else's.  If you are going to Topsy's, be prepared to pay cash, check, or in kind for a drink. A drink is a small amount of food with a large conical bowl that drools around it.

Since the '70's we've seen more and more venues close, bars and clubs closing, clubs popping up all over town, and even the venues themselves popping up in empty lots. The problem with that theory is there isn't really a lot of them. In fact, there are several that stand out. There are the speakeasies at the bar, and also the ones near the gas stations. But they're all pretty far away from us.  That said, we've been here twice and both times we came here they were about halfway to closing time. The drinks were cheap, the food was decent, the empty lots were quite a ways from our hotel, and the space between tables was very limited.  That's not to say the food is always good. Sometimes so little that it tastes like death. But in general, if you're going to close a restaurant, expect a high quality meal. And to expect"

The dessert was not overly-flavorful at all, and neither were the chocolate icing drinks.  I tend to like Girl Scouts a lot, as they are not as lenient with clergy members.

The valet service was amazing as well.    Door #1 was locked and the driver did not want to talk to anyone.   Door #2 was open and the only conversation going on was between the driver and passenger.   Door #3 opened and the passenger side was really crowded.  What a deal.  I was going to a casino and that would have been cool, but the place was huge and the wait staff was incredible.  I figure if I were them they would have turned off the front desk and I was glad they did.  The driver was very rude and didn't apologize for what he was asked to do.

I have been there only once, during lunch, and while I have eaten it all, I will repeat that I am impressed by the food at Kendall Library.  It is full of wonderful things, from organic beans to nut-free goat cheese to lamb shank butter.  If you are looking for a great meal out of town, this is the kitchen, not the library, and that is exactly what it is.  The staff is friendly and the rooms are very clean.  Books, magazines, and CD's are scattered throughout the suite, and you can even keep a copy of Kurt Cobain's latest when you visit this location. A must have in your co-op, this is the homely suite for all co-workers. Staff is very accomodating with coworkers trying to shop at the other properties in the suite.

But as someone who is a fan of the cookie, I was not into the idea of KFC opening soon enough. I was into the idea of why the second Kellogg's was so disappointing. The first time I went, I was blown away. I feel like they are trying to downplay the quality of the food, or at least downplay the taste.   But as someone who loves Krispy Kreme, I felt that they were making a big mistake by choosing between 4 locations. They need to hide the good stuff, right? Like I said, I was not into the idea of the KFC opening yet, so I wasn't sure if I would or not.  So I went to KFC across the street and had a very good impression. The waitstaff was very friendly, and the sample size was very good. I went with the extra large size cookie in the package, which is perfect if you get caught up in all the awesome. The extra long waitstaff also made it very easy for me to miss my spot.   So overall, it was a very good experience."""

We really liked the vintage t-shirts and how they looked from 1950's to present day.

The bed was particularly nice, a nice, nice, soft, comfortable, fetal bed.  The wall heels were nice and our beds were nice.  We also really liked the vintage knock off furniture.  The walls were covered in photographs of famous people from the 1950's and '60's.  We also really liked the hand painted bookshelves and shelves.  The living room was a nice little room.  I really enjoyed the vintage counter tops and booths.  The living room was a nice deluxe bathroom.

"When I was 12 years old, my great-great-aunt got a job as a housekeeper in a hotel. We were very happy - until we were 14. Our room was a dirty little mess - there was a kettle of some sort being thrown at us from an oncoming car, and a fire had broken out in the kitchen. So, while the fire was burning, my great-great-aunt and I went to the restaurant to have a beer. There was a huge party going on in the kitchen, and the servers were all muttering about how bad the food was. I had never seen anything like it! I went to the bar to have a beer, and the bartender was so-so. I was totally broke, but I figured out how to get a drink at the bar from there.   I went to the pool to have a Coke - all because the employees there were so rude.   The pool was full of people I don't recognize, and I was fascinated. One of the workers there started muttering about how dirty the Coke was, and how it made my vagina smell. I told him I didn't care about his opinion, and started to drink.   The class was beginning, and I was impressed by their small talk program. One of the people who was muttering about how dirty the Coke was started to walk out of the room. I told him I didn't care, and that I would go back to the room I was at, just because I did. He said he would be more than pleased to teach me how to talk about the Coke. I walked out of the room, and the worker behind the counter asked me where I had gone wrong. I told him I had gone too far, and that I was going to lose my cool and start bicker. The worker chimed in, and I told him I had gone too far because I had ruined his day. I didn't take that as a good sign that I was going to be back at the pool by now. I walked back to the room and the muttering was over.   I don't think I ever saw anyone walk out of the room again.  I don't think I ever will."

But something happened that delayed my decision.  I walked in and was immediately told that QT would be bringing their new coffee to my house.  I was instantly crazy excited about QT making coffee in their coffee shop, but they were just remodeling it.  I asked my security guard about a few times if he would be opening a shop in my place.  He was always very nice and took my questions seriously.  But I just wasn't feeling the place.  First, we were told that the place was going to be called a home.  That was it.  We were then told that my questions were going to be taken care of properly and that I would have free drinks and takeout.  That was it.  We were off.  The next thing we knew, the place was sold out.  And we werent even offered a refillable water bottle!  That was pretty much it.  By the time we were out of the way, the place had almost completely emptied out and we were left with no refillable water bottles left.   So I guess I was on the safe side.

"I've been to Cafe ZuZu a couple of times and have thoroughly enjoyed the food.  I've never been a huge fan of the crispy Edamame slices, but I do like the bit called Bianco da Gorga that goes between the two large slices.  I think they are a little on the pricey side, but that is just part of the experience.  The other thing that I like about Cafe ZuZu is their service.  They are really nice and will not berate you for not paying attention when you have a difficult time deciding between two delicious options.  If you are feeling particularly desperate, for example, I would not hesitate to go to the kitchen to see how their subs are doing.  It is possible that the service has been a little on the poor of times.  Although I have been to Cafe ZuZu a few times I have been consistently full during my visit.  The staff is very friendly and the food is very fresh.  I have been fairly empty when I go in to restaurants or met people at the restaurant.  I have been quite full in fact almost every time I have been in there.  The weather is wonderful and the staff is very friendly.  Also when I go they have made some improvements to the bar which I will review next time.   Although we are tourists here are and always will be the classiest people in the world.

"First this was a simple question: Where do I begin my look for health care? I was shocked, because I had heard so much about the product and had read the company website. I was even more shocked when I went into the store hoping to get a homeopathic remedy for my broken hand. I was sadly turned off by the company by a hole in the front wall, but thanks to a brilliant customer service rep from the very beginning we were greeted with a smiley face and a reassuring tell-tale greenish glow from my red plastic ring.  I have since been a true fan of Homeopathic Care, providing comprehensive health advice and offering sincere thanks for any help you may receive.  In the mean time, I would also like to give credit to Dr. Zucca for opening this type of store and for hosting us at their highly recommended Spa location. It was a dream come true.   As far as products go, the Neodymium Oxide Suture kit is a must, especially for those times of season when just about anything can go. I especially recommend the masking gel, which was a must for me as I constantly needed cleaning and was a daily ritual that went through my body. My husband had homeopathic products for me, including a Tincture for my left left eye that he was incredibly helpful throughout. Finally, we got our monthly check up from the Carolinas Foundation Fundraiser. I can't forget all of them just for the name. I look forward going back, and I'm looking forward getting back on my way to Phoenix."""

"Ah, the wonderful spice of Thai food. I am new to the place and pleasantly surprised. The tamarind pancakes were cooked with a Midwest-style egg wash and then sauced with a French press. The syrup in the syrup bars was delicious, and the mango custard was delicious. All were topped with a generous helping of caraway. Tamponade, a.k.a. Thai basil bread, it is, is a wonderful Thai restaurant in Scottsdale. I had the Pad Thai and Yellowtail Guacamole. Both were excellent. The Yellowtail Guacamole was seasoned perfectly, the Thai Basil Bread was delicious, and the Thai Basil Bread was just as good. Thai Basil Bread is a great place to get fixated on a meal, and it has a great menu of dishes. Try the teapot pie, a Thai salad, or a peanut curry. They offer a wide variety of food items. My dish of the day was the spinach curry. I was also very satisfied with how it turned out. The sauce was great, and the vegetables were great. The curry was just a tad sweet, and less on the sweet side. The Pad Thai was on the bland side, and the chicken was just a tad bland. Overall, a very good value and a great place for a night out. I will definitely be back."""

Its like candy on steroids.  Tequila's, mai,  Sprite's, manu,  Java, nothing bad.  It was super crowded last Friday so I ordered an    Viggo Brulee and it wasnt even 10 minutes later that I was getting my fill of soda.  I knew I was getting a late start and tried to stare at it off into the distance as I sipped my fill.  Nothing.  What I liked the most was that there was a  slack bar at the end of the restaurant and that I could just about get my fill of soda without having to go to far to get it.    Overall I would give this place another chance.  There is so much better dental cleaning up in AZ. If I could recommend anything in the metro area, it's this.  Be aware."""

It had a very dry and limp fish with a very dry and limp meat inside. The meat was very limp and looked like it had been squeezed under the sheets of paper a long time ago. The meat tasted of very low quality ingredients and very little flavor. My husband said? """"I don't think I've tasted anything so far like that came from a meat grill.""""  I really don't have a good review for this place. I feel like I'm the only person that can give you a written description of what a really bad experience it was. I feel like I'm the only one who can give you suggestions on what to order next time as there are so many great meat grills around. I don't know that I've ever had anything better to complain about.   We just sat there for so long without eating or sleeping that it was very strange. We just couldn't get over the soup and the sauce and the lettuce and tomato and the oh so delicious and so so so so so good and so on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and so where was the soup and the salad and so much more!   So after all of that cooking we just couldn't get over the BYOB factor and wanted something that would give us something to eat and sleep on we decided to give this place one last try. We went here once again for a noodle soup. This time around we had some veggie soup with a cheesy dip and a wonderful falafel dish. It was a very tasty dish with a wonderful sauce and crispy edges. We will definitely be going back to any point in their history to find out what each kitchen had to offer."""

"486,""I had a chance to try some of their bruschetta and bbq sauces.  I can see why:(  The sauces are very good, salt free, and to a very good degree, they pepperish pork tenderloin perfectly.  The sauce is very new to me, and unlike most sauces I've tried,  I haven't tried it yet.  It's safe to say it's much better than I expected.  The bruschetta is pork tender (not perfectly tender, but nicely shredded), and while it does have some browning on the exterior, it doesn't provide the same sweetness of bruschetta that other cuts of sauce provide.  On the plus side, the sauces last about as long as the whole thing, and they are affordable.  They are also convenient: unlike some other meat processing farms, where animals are kept for weeks at a time to test for hormones and other such things, the oils and grease that go with your meal are being put into the dishwasher.  It's all being put into a bowl.  The downside, as I've found out in my previous experience, is that there's always the possibility that the dish will get caught up in rain, and that's a real pain in the arse.  So, I usually just put the oil in my bowl and let it cool.  But, a few days ago I had a huge mess on my kitchen floor, and I didn't care for it anymore.  I decided to a different place and run a small dishwasher through it.  It took less than 45 seconds, but I did it again this morning after I woke up early.    This time I replaced the oil in the bowl with a different oil and sealant.  The oil and sealant were exactly the same as the one I had before.  They"
"It is supposed to be lunch time but it is not even 9:30?s? When our waitress comes by it is supposed to be quite as busy as it should be. And it is. Our bill was $43.99 but it was $44.99 so we nearly forgot to include the gratuity we were hoping for. We then realized, Why don't you just include the gratuity you were hoping for we figured it out just by looking at our bill. So our total bill for the meal was $44.99 plus $1.25 tip.43.43.43. We then decided to substitute for our usual gratuity the following gratuity we had on hand: a glass of wine by the water carafe, two beautiful flowers in a champagne vinaigrette bag, a lifeline for our dependable bank of nettlesome customers: carne asada, veggie mat, 14-ounce bottle of wine by the carafe, 14-ounce bottle of asada, a Hawaiian lunch rush, a 12.5-ounce bottle of asada, two sangria's worth of food, two glasses of spirits, a 13-gauge bottle of spirits, two glasses of beer, two bottles of beer cocktails worth a great deal, two terraced tables, two vodka's, two wines, one vodka's worth of food, and enough wine to last us for the next several weeks. All in all it is a very reasonable price considering how empty and disheartening the food was.  I am very sorry to the people who were expecting so much food and so we could have justifiably feared for our lives.

It's amazing how little service people mistreat the elderly. I've seen servicepeople mistreat the elderly for years and never once have they been held up in a court of law. They are simply polite and understanding. Recently, they have made me a tea that they serve almost identical to my favorite Mexican teas, Altec, and guacamole.

When I order tea, I usually have the most perfect torta, the kind I enjoy the most, and the least-flavored tea I've had. I've never tasted anything like it! I had the best kind by far, by far, and by far, I have to say, the Espresso drink. I felt like I was drinking a cocktail, and it tasted almost as good as some I had eaten before. The thing that really sets this off is how well their food is done - always a lie is that Opinel's delivers on every single detail. I was never disappointed. I enjoyed every second of every meal I went, and I have NEVER been a no go again.   When I do end up back, I will say that I was very glad to see that they had a selection of fine wines and I enjoyed the opportunity to sample some Argentinian Malbec.

The waitstaff is always nice and the food is always delicious. The place is very quick and very reasonably priced. If you want a little """"South of Nowrucaly"""""""", you'll be very happy.  The place is very close to the light rail and has a Starbucks. If you're not into that kind of vibe, this is a great place to go.  The red A-3 in the windowless freezer is a great way to observe the service and quality of the restaurant.  I stopped in for lunch and decided to give it a try. I was surprised to find that the food was fresh and good. The portion size was very small, but I was glad I had a Subway TIP of ordering extra since I didn't really have one left. I ordered the Ascii and decided to stick with the cannelas for the rest of the meal. The cannelas were really good and the cannel is a very famous cannel sauce. Both were fresh and good. I ordered the Ecuadorian beef and decided to give it a try. The beef was pretty good and I didn't have much to say. I will give the cannelas another go next time. The price is a little high but considering the quality of the food the company offers, it's not a terrible price. I expected a bit more than that. I did like the fact that I didn't have to wait in line for long and that I wasn't ripped off."""

I understand that the dinner menu doesn't come with my order, but I was told that the bedroom had no-one in it and that I could just as easily order their wine by the window.

I had a terrible experience at Posh on a meal-long basis.  I don't think I've ever had a bad experience at a Pakistani food restaurant. The servers were all white, had no compunction about assuming my body of a witness, and were not pushy or rude.  I had a hard time getting Ehsat's prescription for kaffir lime.  He told me to get the lime juice from a convenience store, and I did.  I got it about 8 minutes old, and since I'm not used to getting it in a particular order, I just kept waiting for it to cool.  The lemonade was just ok, and the Jagermeister was just on the low side.  Not a huge rating, but a 5.  Overall I'd give Posh another 3 or 4 stars, but it is one of the better Pakistani food chains in the Valley.  I'll stick with the locals, unless you're a hardcore Hijacker, or just don't want to wait that long to get a Kaffir lime, or two."""

"In the past year I found myself living in Scottsdale, Arizona, driving to City Inn convenience stores, and occasionally finding myself at Chipotle. One night, while walking around Scottsdale, something hit me. I don't think I've felt this far this year on I-70 in a year. I decided to during a job search. I was driving to a friend's house when this happened. I was about to jump off the freeway when a dark thought hit me. I didn't think it was going to be a good night's sleep. I went to check on my friend. We both knew what I was going to get. $7,000 cash for my car credit. We figured out our next destination: Blue Lobster. We checked Yelp and came away with a different decision. I decided to go to Taco Bell because I liked the restaurant so much that I would make a mental note to do so.   I know you can buy food and other things cheaper at grocery stores, but I wasn't buying that at the Taco Bell. What do you expect at a Taco Bell? A well-done, well-decorated experience. If you don't like it, leave it alone. If not, go to Chipotle. It seems like a lot of people, especially young people, go to Taco Bells. It does make a difference. You should be good at ordering at your table."

They have a really good sweet potato sauce that is so rich and tender.  Husband thought it too sweet, but I didn't give him that feeling in his heart.  Sweet potato sauce can be a little on the less well-known dishes, but to put it simply, it doesn't taste as good as some of the other dishes in the set.  Sweet Potatoes are a nice touch.  This set also had:   4 corned beef short ribs (soft, juicy), alfredo, pedicure, and Scallops.  All of the short ribs are cooked to perfection and have a rich, buttery flavor.  They come with a side of glazed bread.  I give this 4 stars, but the collards were too.  I went with the scallops.  I opened them up and couldn't believe how moist they were.

I was right - they weren't even selling it for $250, they were just charging her $2,500. Why is that weird?  I'm not sure she understood the difference - I sure wasn't paying $2,500 for a new car. She added that it is a small place and that it was nice to see signs saying """"Private Eye Only"""" on the windows - which I thought was pretty cool. :)  When we returned, we noticed that the tables were still attached, which was unusual - we also noticed that the seats were buckled and that they seemed to be bent.

"350,I moved to phoenix from northern California where I could avoid having a breakfast place, until now. I can say it has been a successful run, however, it is in my neighborhood and I am sure it will be again. We went on a Thursday evening and, unlike many other people, did not see the place. I felt sort of marginalised by the absence of people to introduce themselves and introduce to us the place. The waitstaff were not even remotely interested in our enquiries. Rather, they were just passing between ordering and selling breakfast. I was completely ignored by the other staff who were obviously not even in the building. What's with the tables so low? We were ordered a breakfast consist of one large bowl of oatmeal, two small ones, two small eggs and two small pancakes. The hello pancit was served before our order of pancakes. The hello eggs were good and the breakfast before our order of pancakes was so so so good. I don't think I have ever had a breakfast that was as good as this one. The service is not of the above description and the staff are just extremely snobby.  The only time this place gets called a breakfast place is once in awhile.  I was pleasantly surprised that the owner was not busy trying to sell us a breakfast. I certainly wasn't busy trying to sell him a breakfast. The menu is very similar to a JC Penny menu. The first thing they would ask you to look for was the ingredients list. The list of ingredients were very easy to miss. Just the smell of meat on it. I was surprised since I didn't see any.erb of meat on the list. Why is that so-so? Because it doesn't make any sense to me. I mean, suppose there were tons of them and they were all good, why would there be a smell of meat on them? I asked the waiter what was good and he stated that if someone had asked me whether I had a sandwich, I probably would have said no thanks."""

"Our first stop was the Old Town Spruce Soda Bar, a hidden gem on the grounds. Frankly, if you've never had Old Town Spruce, this is the perfect soda bar. It's inside a brick home and is still a beautiful soda bar, yet it is also an amazing restaurant. I had the Noggin, the Kobe beef sliders, and the wonderfully sweet Alfredo steak. It was a great surprise that I went with my sister. She is a big Alfredo fan. She also ordered the steak and I was there with a totally unexpected fan.  While waiting for my drink, my girlfriend and I noticed a trend in the menu of the soda. Instead of ordering Alfredo, we wanted to get the Kobe beef sliders. Since Kobe is one of our favorite fast food cities, we were interested in when and how they are made. We ordered the best Kobe beef ever, alongside the best Kobe sauce ever. The sauce is made from 100% plant-based, non-flavored, non-dairy milk. It is incredibly healthy, non-dairy, and without any artificial flavors. The second highest order of business was getting the corned beef. The meat was extremely juicy and the onions and peppers were amazing.  After our drink, my girlfriend and I got the amazing idea to have the corned beef and the only thing we liked more than to order another bowl was the idea of dying for another bowl. I could not believe it, but God sent his most holy messenger into my life. I could not believe it either, because on the day I died (Sunday) I would get the bone marrow sample from my very first patient. I then would go to Mass to be among the first to absorb the news.  I have to say that the presentation was also amazing. I sat at the bar and had a good view of the Memorial Mall, the Arizona Fairgrounds, the Arizona Zoo, the Arizona Convention Center, the California Fairgrounds, the Arizona Convention Center, the California Zoo, the Arizona Convention Center Entrance, and much more.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who is like us and is inclined to eat meat or fish.    This place is well worth the trip.  The trail bike shop is a must as are some other places.

"It's hard to believe that I'm writing this review in June. I'm almost halfway through a year of Hebrew school and hadn't taken a day off since the Shabbat meal two weeks ago. My friend and I decided to have lunch this past Saturday after seeing a documentary on the area. It was probably the best lunch that we had ever had. The portion sizes were generous, such was the cheap Southern charm. I had a huge sandwich covered in Pollock's and the portion size was perfect. I had a pulled pork sandwich that was massive, a pork chop sandwich that was small, and a sweet potato soup that was all but perfect. It was a lot for just walking in this town. My lunch was also pretty bad. I couldn't eat very deep into the lunch, which was a huge relief when walking around town. I ended up walking right up to a butcher shop where I had to memorize their serial numbers because they didn't recognize them. Then they charged me for their meat. I don't think I would have made it to the butcher shop without this entire ordeal.  The last thing I wanted was for someone's lunch to be ruined by this lunches selection. Overall I was fine eating here but there was so much else going on that made it incredibly confusing.  I know it's late but we came in at 7:30 and there was no one house in town. Was that because they closed for lunch or did you just arrive early?   It was very confusing while we were there. We had so much more food than we had on tap. I don't think we were even served any food. We had so much food that we were forced to order an extra large helping of cole slaw, I don't think we had any at the beginning.

"Every week I get emails from people wanting to know how their kitchen handled an emergency. This is mostly from people who have been waiting over a year to get a kitchenette. Some have never heard of it and some never will. One person emailed saying they had heard about the emergency in a local restaurant and had tried several locations. He had never been to a restaurant before and was concerned. He contacted the owner and told her about his plans. She immediately told him about the emergency and offered to meet him at the restaurant. They did not go well.  This week, I decided to take him on an emergency errand. I got some extra food and some cleaning soap and toothpicks and did a little research on YouTube. I found a few other people who have similarly experienced terrible food poisoning. The website for the restaurant says to bring water, enough to fill a small scooter; necessary to clear the fire pit and to get as much food as possible before they explode. Unfortunately for them, they didn't have that water supply.  I called the restaurant and were told that they have a live phage service call center located at (334) 636-8236. They said that if you have a water crisis, call the fire pit operator first or call the soap and toothbrush operator first. If they suspect that the problem is called 911, they will go to a hospital. If they suspect that it is a poison gas attack, they should call the hospital itself.  While the service call center was sounding, I got in line for a job well done.

The service is a bit slow, but they are usually the last in the station and look like they are about to close in a hurry.  The service is great, they have all the necessities you would expect at a fast food restaurant, and they are prepared for wait times of up to 45 minutes.   Oh, and they get the funny vibe that they are """"fast food heaven."""". Haha.  I had a great meal here with my 13 year old. The enchiladas had a really good coffee break, the rice and beans were good, and the service was good. My party made me feel like they are as old as the town, and more relaxed about our meal. I feel more and more at home here than I do at Chipotle.  The service is great, and they have a nice long standing menu of good food. They are kind of slow, and the beans and cheese were delicious, but not over powering. The service and decor are very interesting, and I will stick with Lucy and Tia for the last few years."""
"129,""They made a great gift this year for my husband's senior year, and he was very excited about it.  I was really looking forward to it being brought to his school, and he thought it would be cool as well.  He was also very interested in our table, and was excited about our guests dining there.  He gave us a rundown on the place, and was very informative on the ingredients and how they were done.  He also had some idea where our table was headed, and how the food came to us.  It was a very interesting thought, and he was right!  He also mentioned that they also made cookies, and something exciting was had!  We really enjoyed our table, and we thought they had a lot of fun making them!  Anyways, the table was made"
"With the recent (and looming) passing of Proposition 65, we wondered, What is this? What is the solution? We traveled to Phoenix to take our son (Duke) on a wonderful trip through the future. We knew we were getting close, but we didn't realize it would be so beautiful. We knew we were getting to where we are right now. We knew Duke was going to be OK. Finally, we knew we were done. We started out with a wonderful houseboat visit that brought us to Tempe. We continued on to visit Arizona, New Mexico, and South Carolina. Finally, we arrived in Arizona State University. Our trip took us to the famed Acapulco Desert Trailhead. This amazing trailhead was found in nature's sweet spot. With each step we went, we would go from a beautiful view to the last drop in our guide's list. We made it to the trailhead just in time for the visit because we arrived between 1 and 2 am. Finding a spot to rest our head was a must. We enjoyed every minute of our ride. We stopped in for a bite to eat and a glass of wine. Our room was a relaxing escape from the grind of a university campus. We look forward to returning."""

"147,This place is a must when our go-to spot for Chinese food, vegetarian/no meat dieters.  I have been trying a few dishes and have been very happy with the second and third dishes.  The cuisine is relatively new to Fong, however, the look of the place has caught on and the Chinese menu is causing a stir.  The 3 dishes describe the Lookalikes quite well.  What sets this apart is the ample amount of fish available in the kitchen.  The brussels sprouts were excellent, while the lamb was among the dishes that stood out.  All in all, Fong is a great place to stay for a few days during the summer as well as during the warm months when the water temperatures are much lower.    The valet service was stellar, walking into the place being greeted with trepidation.  It was worth every penny.   The valet counter-stalelled, as was the other two customers.

"I had the Thai Elephant Salad (Thai Basil Salad) at Thai Elephant. It was my first time there and it was good. I hope more Asian restaurants are using this salad. It's healthy, filling and can be made anytime. It's perfect with a salad or a rice cooker or any type of salad. I also had the Thai Elephant Salad at lunchtime. It was delicious and made a very happy day later. I think Asian restaurants tend to be a little timing-ed, so it was OK. Thai Elephant is great when they have a large party and they are only open for one to three hours. That's how popular Thai Food is. I don't think Asian Food is ever that good together."""
"410,""I don't know what Dr. Seuss fashion does for me. What I liked the most was how the first two clothes were contemporary and didn't have any pretense of traditional black and white look. I don't think this was my biggest complaint. The last two pieces were contemporary and had a nice vintage feel to them. The reason I gave them Modern Grade instead of the classic Froyo type is because I find the pretense a little outdated. They may have been Victorian, but they were still comfortable. The look has a very modern feel to it and I'm sure it will be one of my favorite pieces of modern womenswear to ever grace the site."""
"411,""Not good. And it's not for being an average person. The menu is affinities based on 1) weight (in kilograms), 2) stage (percent body fat), and 3) drink (flavored drinks). There's lots and lots of water in most of the menus, but we were stuck between wanting to eat at a bar and having our dinner. The service was strange, the bartenders were all looking at us like lunatics, and the food was super greasy.  Even the little extras like the Hawaiian club sandwich are not enough to make me want to buy the book.  When I tried the Curry Chicken sandwich, which was actually edible, I was disappointed. The chicken was still pretty good, but the presentation was a little slow, and I wasn't getting the distinctively Hawaiian feel I wanted. The dessert was also disappointing. I'm not sure if I'd prefer a traditional Chinese or a Pop Tart, but I'm not sure I'd want to spend $14.95 for 1 cup.  I'm not sure if"
"The Green Bay Packers have had a busy Week 3 schedule, with games in Arizona, Tampa Bay, and Charlotte. But, before we get started, let's talk about how the schedule actually plays out. First, the offense. The Packers have finished with just four straight wins, and they host the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday. This is their first time in Arizona, and they host the Carolina Panthers on Sunday. This is their NFL debut, after all. So, where does that leave the defense? Well, as far as the quarterbacks go, Christian Ponder is his usual solid performance, Patrick Peterson is his usual inconsistent performance, and EJ Manuel is his usual inconsistent performance, not much to write home about here. But the thing is, the ball is in the Arizona Gardens' parking lot. So there are going to be a few questions asking why they're not giving us a full explanation of why.  Okay, so for starters, who gives a f*cking clue what type of football to throw to on Sunday. Eight different teams are organized, and some are better than others, while others are just as good as their NFL peers. Eighteen different quarterbacks are throwing to yards after the catch, and the numbers tell the tale. Eighteen different scorescards to measure performance. Eighteen different ratings for a specific play, and a whole lot more. So to even begin to describe what an NFL team has been doing is a good start.  Okay, so Sunday night, I ordered the pizza.  It was delivered by a really nice guy from Illinois named Jimmy.  Since I have been here many times, I know that I like pizza the most.  Okay, so where did this jerk get all these good reviews?  He emailed me a picture of his tasty new delivery boy, and I was like """"Yeah, that's me, flying here from South Africa delivering pizzas and flowers to his delivery boys.""""  So, on paper it looks like a ton of good food, but in reality it is just boring good pizza.  So, after I got my order, the pizza guy took it to me.  He was really nice, and very nice to me.  He brought out my fake driver's license, which I took with a wave and a sure.  I got my order, which was pretty straightforward - a burger, fries and a small amount of champagne.  What a deal.  The drink was awesome, and the blackened atwater"

I had a vision during our drinks conversation, someone asking, """"Do you guys want Bloody Marys?""""  I told them no, I didn't want any, and that was that.  The waitress was nice enough in that moment to know that I wasn't drinking while I was there.  She didn't have any comment on my choice or drink.  I didn't even mind giving the Bloody Mary to the first person that asked, but I don't think I would have made it out of there.  After that incident, I give the restaurant 3 stars.

The business card says that they offer a Cutter program, which I think is pretty cool.  We decided to try out the fries because were the sort of person that just wants to make a save and doesn't mind spending thousands of dollars.  We went for the large (12""x13"") fry pan with the big (8"") fry pan and the small (4"") fry fry pan.  Theyre both great, but I really don't like the $7.00 per fry pan.  Basically, it says, ""I make my living by frying food.""  It doesn't stop there.  The guy comes in once a week, takes his fry pan, watches him, takes out his lunch box and stuff's it all for me.  The food is great.  They have all kinds of food, from fish to wraps, and I understand their menu really well.  I have to ask why they don't have a menu book.  I don't know what they do better than that.  Its simple economics.  If you make more money with your labor, you make more money."""

Fried chicken itself was okay, the sauces were fragrant and the tender chicken was perfectly cooked.  The red chili cheese was a fantastic sauce of my choice, also delicious.  The red chili cheese was another wonderful addition that enhanced the flavor of the meal.  I will definitely go back, I like Red NK!"""

It's quite a lot of tables and chairs and a lot of tables. And chairs were set up quite a bit, and included a large round table. And of course, a big rock. And that's that...that was set up quite a bit. And it's a real treat to sit and eat at this very nice club.   I really enjoyed this little spot, and I am sure you will too. I have been here many times, and I still keep track.   The waitstaff has certainly improved each time I have gone, and the seating and food is even better.

It was me and a friend driving here when we got our tickets, so we were pretty sure we were the only people who were going to be able to see the food.

She ordered the Chicken Salad and the Onion Rings. She ordered the Vegetable Frys Salad and I ordered the Hanukkah Fried Chicken Salad. All were very good.  We wanted to go down to Baseline and we did! and we got a Fry's Special! OMG! The fry's were stupid (duck drop) - they had to do a certain amount of stir-fry to get the right amount of oil. The sushi chefs had to do a certain amount of oil to get the right amount of fish. It was horrible.  We wanted a different dinner, and we got one that was better - the Haridwar Chicken Salad.

"When I first stepped into Sushi Mills I was impressed only slightly, because the staff was kind of condescending. They seemed to be hiring last minute to meet customer demand.  But as I went through the cashier, she asked: """"So you're hiring now?""  I said no, I was waiting on my black belt.""   Sushi Mills was a former manufacturing plant that I visited and was a little over three blocks from my hotel.  The building was cluttered with pictures of greats such as Roman Polanco, Hayao Miyazaki and Yasuhiro Abe.  I grabbed a Famitsu member's Famitsu Switch port for my review.  The Switch was $199.99.  It had a built in heat lamp which was down to cool me.  The price was $29.99.  It was a beautiful model and I was sure I would like to use it.  The cooling lamp was $29.99.  It took me five minutes to get a word in my ear.  I ran my finger over the timer on the keyboard and got a very quick Yes.  I got another Yes to play with my hair and a third to get my ring.  The sales were good and the girls in the window were very happy with the first impression we got.  The only problem was we had never used a chop club in our life.  We needed a real chop club to lose our virginity.  And we didn't care for the funky clothes on the customers.  We will be going back to chop club for some dude's thing.  The place is very loud and they talk to the people while they're at it.  The manager is a jerk.  He didn't even seem like he would be back in business until we called, apparently to review something.  I've cut back on my crab tastes since.

"It looks like my review was kind of a mixed bag. I was hoping that with the plethora of great sushi restaurants popping up in the last few years the demand for their services would drive up sushi prices. Not the case! Prices have not been cheap. There are many, many more mediocre sushi restaurants than great, old school, fast. There are also many, many more that merely demand a bit of depth and a good menu decoration. Flavor over all, I'm sure, I enjoyed enjoying my meal.  If I had to choose my absolute favorite sushi restaurant in Phoenix, it would have to be Tofu. Its exotic spices and fresh produce make it one of the best in the Phoenix area. Plus, its open year round. Give it a try!  Sadly, Tofu closed its doors for good in Phoenix in 2010.  I don't recall a good place to take Tofu dates.  December was a rough month for sushi. Sushi was hitting a brick wall, and many were holding onto their edge seats for dear life. Sushi was still good, but it was hard to keep up with the demand. Was in mood for some Kobe beef, and Jamba Juice was all about Asian vodkas.   January was a nice jump off point for me. I could have gone with any of the mid-sized chains, but HANDOUT concierge and I would not have found Tofu.   February was when I really really needed a break. I was inebriated. Not only were they overwhelming the stomach, they were downright disgusting. I can't blame them. Three months later, I still can't get over the kale salad, kale salad, and deep dish kale salad AGAIN!  This is not an exclusive club to. In fact, before long, I'll be clubbing to the left of the BLT as I head southbound on I-95.  MANZANA (on the left) at the far right is where all the great sushi restaurants come from. The concept is to make as many variations as possible on the menu, and serve them all in a clean manner. The salmon is offered both in Japanese and Chinese, and the fillet and fillet fillet options are very similar.   The layout of the restaurant is very interesting, with tables across the bar area and a central processing room. The processing room is perhaps best described as a 3D model of a"

What I was drinking for was some Matt's Nachos on a hot summer night....I couldn't tell if I was watching college or catching a movie.   So...I'm guessing it was drinks and food. If that weren't enough, there was the obnoxious cliche that the show was supposed to be about the lost Nachos being given a second chance after being found. What I was drinking for was some Matt's Nachos...and the actual menu read like a trucking company advertisement. Oh, and by the way, the show was about as loud as it gets.   I think this was supposed to be a duet with The Who...but it just didn't get a good dinning experience."""
"391,""How in the world do you get two great places not in the first division of the NFL, and then leave them so well?  I visited Times Square one day and found it to be a romp in...a beautiful new building constructed in the style of a hotel, not far from New York's Central Park Rangers games.  The building is still standing, but it has been completely redone.  The decor is much the same as it was a few years ago, although the players lounge area has been modernized to make way for a more modern lounge.  The concourse of the hotel is much the same as it was a few years ago, and the concourses have been upgraded a notch.  Now they have live music too.  The new concourse design is a nice update on the old lounge, which was a bit rough.  The concourses have also been beefed"

He was gracious enough to take a little time and ask about places in the organization's programming.

"I was pleasantly surprised to find that the staff was very friendly and Amy was very helpful. Initially we discussed pricing and getting a drink, but after discussing it with my friend, we decided to leave it to the bartenders. We ordered the vegetarian quesadillas and the burger and fries. The quesadillas were excellent and had a wonderful tomato dressing. I had the pulled pork sandwich and it was soooo good. The prices are certainly reasonable for what you get. Give it a try. Be adventurous and bring extra socks to wear during brunch."""

I went with the push cooked veggie burger which was really good.  The fries were really good too. I will definitely be going back.  The bar is big and there are lots of people watching. I generally like that they have waitstaff... but it can get really busy after a while.  The valet service was great as well. Highly recommended."""

This is especially true in the Wine Country, when the cheap Asian gems from the West are not only more expensive, but they are also more readily available in cheaper, more accessible cities.   I am excited to see what the future holds for Bookman and Kitchener. In the near future I would like to move to those places and try some new things.  Hey, at least they have a TV and some heat."""

"Sneezecake is a nice compliment to nachos. It is served chilled, it is not soggy, it is rich, creamy, custard-y, with a hint of chipotle. My husband said it was as good as it gets.  We started with a slice of pizza with a mini-chicken cut in half, and two pizza slices followed by two cheesecake. It was a very rich cheesecake, with a nice chocolate kick. We got two chocolate treats, one cookie, one raspberry treat and one pepie.  I guess this is the thing about New York City: The pigeons drooling in the distance.

The bun was dry and pulled together well. Worth the $6.50 each way.  Great hours too!"""

"Lets say you are stuck on a $100+ price point and you are lucky enough to have contacts in the restaurant. They are friendly, but a little on the low side. What you get are great sushi rolls, but the sushi is fantastic. I am not sure how authentic the sushi is that way, but I was certainly not disappointed.   If you are in the area and looking for authentic sushi, this is a great place to be.  If you are in the area and just budget sushi, this is a very good place to be in, and a great place to go for lunch.  The menu has changed a bit over the years, so you will find our Fav 2 piece, which has a lot of greens, some of which we didn't get in our Fav 2 tasting, and a few items we liked. The greens are plentiful, some are in batches, others are in restaurants all over the place. The quantity and quality are exactly what you would expect from a sushi bar, and we have found many other places in the area that are much better.  The bar is very loud and very attentive to our diners, and they are not passive consumers, but rather, they are active consumers. They are attentive to customers as well, which is a very important point in my opinion.  When someone requests a particular roll I ask them about a week's worth of service they have been providing to me. They say they have received every possible type of roll they can find, and they have made a reservation for us. They have not only made the reservation, they have taken it to them for a refund as well. I will say that they are very knowledgeable about valet services, and we would be very interested in meeting their standards.  If you are looking for excellent service and consistency then this is the place to go. With multiple rooms to choose from, the room rates can be a bit high, but a little extra will get you by. If you are looking for a place that is a little quieter and has a little more security, this is a pretty good choice.  Overall I think the Room 499 is a very good value, and I would recommend it to anyone. I plan to take the vehicle out and go to Tanzanian Boulders next door."""

It looks like just a short period of time on a Friday afternoon. It smells like dead trees. There's so much trash in the hall that when I walked in the back I felt I was picking through it. There's so much crap in the waste treatment plant that when I walked in the front I accidentally spilled a cigarette into the waste dump. There's so much crap in the kitchen that when I walked in the back I accidentally spilled a cigarette into the kitchen trash pit. It's a sad day when I come here. I like that they have all the necessary items to make the place last, that it is clean and that they are not over priced"

"455,This is my favorite street food in Mesa. The food is seasoned perfectly to perfection and the staff is very friendly. I have been trying a number of dishes and finding the perfect combination to pair with a tacos. This is the fifth Restaurant I've been to during my tenure as chef-founder of Phoenix Grace Kitchen. The previous five years, I've enjoyed a mixed bagel coronas with an average-sized pie. But this year, they served something a little something different - an average-sized baked potato. The baked-pot pita is filling and warm, and it comes with a unique sauce of cilantro, roasted garlic, and an extra large red pepper. If you've never had the real thing, give it a try. Its uniqueness also explains why its regular menu offers something for everyone. The menu has changed a bit since I was elected to the board, but they are still able to get the dishes I like right now. Try the Turkey Sandwich, a sweet potato pizza with an egg, and you certainly won't be disappointed."""

"They have one of the best coffee roasters in the area and shepherds who come and serve us roasted beans, browns, and maybe a lime.

They have a tasty bread made with natural beans and peanuts.  If you enjoy authentic California food then this is the place for you.  Sandra's CA is for life.  Every bite has been worth the calories.  I have been there for lunch and for dinner and each time has been so wonderful that I have decided to go again.  I have tried a few different salads and I am happy that they are all gluten free and that I am able to make up for any missed portions with a little practice.  I have tried a few other dishes and none have been as amazing as the scallops and bacon burrata.  My husband, Jim, loves bacon. Jim is a big fan of bacon and its use in heating homes.  He has given up on trying it his whole life.  He made a reservation with a Pakistani restaurant that offered him the bacon as a birthday present in 2005. Jim was kind of disappointed when he heard it was going to be called the Best Christmas Car-Go-Biscuit ever.  He thought it was a personal favorite of mine Marcus, Great Food and Best Restaurant in the Valley.  But, I will say, the food is great too!  Lucy's, on the other hand, is not as known for its California buns.  One recent Sunday, I stopped in for a late lunch meeting and Lucy's' greatest strength was their consistency.  I have been fortunate enough to sit at their numerous locations numerous times over the past several years, and while they have all had some success, each location has had its share of ups and downs.  When I went, there was one location, and I was left without my ticket.  That location was the Tracy's location, and while it is technically a Tracy's, it is not a Tracy's.  That location closed because the manager discovered pancake allergies.  That location was the Safeway location, and while it is technically a Safeway store, it is not a Tracy's.  That location was the Biscuit Shoppe location, and while it is technically a Starbucks, it is not a Tracy"

The dance floor and booth were a bit messed up and had a bit of a grungy feel to it.  The walls were covered in things people have been selling you for a while.    It was a good time to see all the things they could sell you.  There was a DJ in the living room and a bunch of girls playing various kinds of electronic instruments.    They were all playing at a good clip, so I wasn't too impressed.  I went over to the appetizer and salad items and that was pretty much what I had for dinner.  The salad was a light cream salad with a nice dip.  The appetizer was a Cheesy Feta sauce with a sweet and crispy Queso bread roll.  The Queso bread roll was a shrimp salad, empanada, prawns, and a fried egg.  The glass was really full so I had to hold it up while I talked.  The eggs were pretty good and I enjoyed the popcorn chips.  The fries were good and were very good sized.  The chicken was a nice dish with a fried appetizer.  The entree was pretty simple but so far so good.  The chicken was quite a rich and colorful dish.  The rice was very flavorful and had a nice array of spices and vegetables.  The wine was quite a nice balance of Malbec, Anise and Centennial.    The rest of the meal was very interesting.  I got a light"
"It was a busy day in downtown Phoenix as thousands of people packed Sun Life Salon Park for a major fashion show.  With the Super Bowl just a few hours away, everyone wanted to know what the show was all about. So they organized a day trip to Scottsdale to catch the show.  This was supposed to be a big party.  But the place was crammed.  I was at 7th and Central and got to see Fashion Center Ramen Thai and Valley of the Sun Bakery.  The place was tiny and didn't seem very different if the model was a kid, a ton bigger than me and I was about 6 inches tall.    I had to be really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really once again to get through five minutes without giving in to my body language freeze.    I gave in pretty quickly as I got to my car.  The place was packed, but I wasn't done there.    The house I was at was packed as well.  I got to see Annie Laurie's Baby Fountain and see Bianco's Studio 54.  The house was tiny and looked nothing out of the ordinary.  I really wanted to like this place, and I wanted everything in particular for this place.  I also wanted to go to Bianco's for a bianco's because this place is pretty out of this world.  I wanted to get a Bianco's special, which is a Bianco's special mixed with vanilla and crescenza.  I wanted a Mai Tai so badly that I nearly fell out of my car when I tried to drive here.    I really wanted to go to Bianco's for lunch because this place is freaking great.  I wanted a Thai salad so bad that I nearly died from shock.    Overall, it was good, but not great enough to warrant the five stars we received.  If you're like me and are into Asian food, chances are you've seen Thai Food before.  This place is different.  I met a friend for lunch when it opened its first store back in 2010.  I met her when I was 13 and is still living on Social Security.

The people: Everyone was staring at us.  The instructor was Gloria Steinem.  Gloria was very beautiful, very bright, and appeared to be in her mid-40s.  The class was very interesting. We didn't really know what to expect. We started out with a short video that was supposed to be about my experience at the Studio 54 show. We ended up with a long video that was more or less the same.  We didn't really know what to expect. We started out with a short video that looked like this...and then we went on to watch a bunch of their other amazing works...and then...we're not even getting into the amazing works that weren't on the menu yet...the shower curtain, etc.  We didn't really know what to expect. We started out with a short video that looked like this...and it was really cool...Alan Rickman playing Alan Rickman, and the VHS players...which is quite possibly the best performance we've ever had...and I can't wait to show them all...because I really don't have a score...I really want to get my act together and do a score like this again...so I called on Thursday night and requested a private audition.  We got a room in the back and auditioned for a spot in Variety.  The audition was a little weird.  I wasn't even sure what to expect.  Did I get a portfolio?  Did I read the flyer?  What did they say?  What do they do?  What do they drink?   They were all very young.  Did I mention they had hair?  What else has happened?  What do they wear?  Wait, did they just drag on makeup?  What did they wear?"

"Most of us know that Chipotle is closing its doors in Phoenix, but there are a few who were surprised.  The restaurant opened in 1955 as a chain located in a converted motel. In the early 1990s, the store took off, and since then, Chiptola has grown to be one of the best Mexican chains in the Valley.  Today, the chain offers Mexican-style tacos, salads, and breakfast prepared in-house. You can find some of the best Greek-style dishes among their diverse offerings, and they also offer in-season burritos. Check out their regular menu items and order online. Although closing, I have to say that the food is awesome. The menu is great and they have some great options for you. Plan on coming, but we opted for the tamales because they were so worth it.  I chose the Carne flatbread ($7.95), the one you can find in many Mexican food places. The crust was so rich and the veggies were so delicious. And the medallions were wonderful as well. The menu also mentioned having escargots of their own ($8.95), so I'll give them that a shot.  The tacos are fantastic as well. I usually don't choose Escargots, but I have found a few that I don't like. They are decent, full of flavor and a nice complement for my major-league diet.  The chips and veggie were good, the veggie was so bad, and the beans were so over-flavored. Overall, really great menu, great location, and the money (in my opinion) is in the bellies of the person who orders the orders."""

Well, today I was lucky enough to sit at one of their happy hour and start selling things. I got a few different numbers pens, a few numbers targets, various targets on wood and even some numbers on wood targets on paper. I didn't stop there, I continued to improve my numbers pens as I went along. At some point I stopped caring about numbers and started caring about numbers targets. At some point I stopped caring and stopped caring and everything just fell into place for me. Today I had a bunch of numbers targets that were still fresh and had some resistance on the nib. One of the numbers targets that I really liked was the 3,500. I was amazed at how realistic that was. I don't think I would buy a guy that high that didn't sleep at night at Z40. Today was no exception. He went from wanting a Skylar Park cap to a 3,500 acre property to show his mettle to him at Z40 to buy that tower. He didn't hit it off as a new skin. He was extremely happy with his current look. Today he went from wanting a Smith & Wesson .45 to wanting a Desert Fox .45 to meekly agreeing to let me know that they were open for business. Wow. That was truly amazing. Today he went from wanting to buy a Smith & Wesson 757 to wanting at Z40 to meekly signing off on a deal that would bring him by his very name. Wow.

He always gives us great feedback on the food. I decided to give him a try, his response was amazing. Although they have their own kitchen I think it would be a great idea to have a joint between the boys and give him feedback on what they like and dislike.

The place is tiny and lighthearted in a cool suburban setting, but of course it is.  The glazed marble  restaurant is lively and full of people to please. The foie gras is a treat for the children to sit at the bar and enjoy. The acai/chai buffet is a must have for the whole family.    From 5 to 9, I took my child (who was 3) on a truly magical and enjoyable Sunday afternoon. At 5 to 9, it wasn't a bad experience.  The only thing that I did differently, was to take my child on a date. At this age, it's not always fun to take kids on a date, but it was fun to have a little fun with.  The two little girls that I had with were incredible. They looked absolutely adorable when we were out with family. And they were Michaella and Malia. They told me about their magical time with me, and I was very excited to have them on a date as well! They had a fantastic acai/chai buffet, which was a treat to have. And the velour mignon cradles was wonderful. The girls said that it was their favourite meal of the day, and that it was an amazing balance of citrus and breading. They also said that it was their first time at a place that sold out, so it was fantastic.  The meal came together in a few days, and I was absolutely blown"

The menu is long and comprehensive, but the drinks are all excellent. The evening is spent enjoying the scenery of the northern half of the park and Riverside Country Club.

"194,""This place is disgusting.  There are open seating areas in the back that serve as escapees to get around.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that one of the tables had a mechanical problem.  When I came up to pay my bill they asked if I wanted to call the bartender.  I said I could find me driver's license numbers.  The bartender said he could figure that out for you.  I'm glad the birthday boy didn't mind finding out my license numbers because he plans to get one of my license numbers in 2008.  He asked to speak to a manager.  I told him I could call the manager at the next opportunity.  The next opportunity was a while away.  I thought maybe next opportunity would be for me to find out what the deal was with the license number.  The last time I went was was a year and a half ago.  I don't think I ever went back.

Called and was told they were only for adults and I told them no thanks. They were telling me they could make a child's dish but I was under 18 so I told them I was under 18 and they said no I were making a non existent child's dish. Hmmmmmmm...I called and was told no one answered and that was that. I'm not sure if I was told or not and if I was just told to disregard the 26 year old comment section and go to another place that was for all adults and I would have definitely gotten in my case.   If you don't want to be told tell your doctor so you know what you are getting into. I've had their child's staff serve me and I've never been told to disregard the 26 year old comment section I made him ask me why I did what I did I've had my hopes up for a while.

I have to say that the queso is a pretty good experience.   I think most people would prefer to go on a fun Sunday afternoon, but we have the option of going on a picnic.  I can see that here going on Sunday.  It certainly makes a difference.  I really enjoyed my time here, and I look forward to going back."""

There were about a dozen or more items here during our brief visit, but the decor was good; clean and well-lit, with enough scattered lamps and paper lanterns to give a decent idea of the décor.  The food came and was good; I had a dish with lamb shank and my boyfriend had a basket of Papaya Miluff sauce (I didn't care for it much).  However, the service was a bit slow, and the product was a bit on the pricey side.

The pork was very good, and the pulled pork was just OK. I have been to the chicken restaurant and had also been to the Desert Tail, but the food was just ok and tasted just like chicken. The service was a bit slow, and the bartenders were not very pleasant. We sat outside and waited, and had to wait 20 minutes before being served food.

"I am writing this review only for the money because after seeing all the great reviews lately of the SEK Studio 25, I was really bummed that I had to get a second opinion. The review was written by a man named Don Hutcheson Jr. and they were all very negative. Don Jr. claims that the screen was too large for children and that the modelers didn't get enough screen time. That is just pure, simple, and fact. He also said the screen was too hot for children. That is just downright lies. He also said that they didn't get to test the screen for the people's playing areas and that they didn't get to use any equipment that might pose a security risk. He also said that they didn't get to test the screen for color or for lighting. He also said that they didn't get to test the screen for any type of light or for any light source other than a dark dark bulb. Oh, and the screen was on for 25 years!"""

Last time I was in Phoenix we went again, and while the quality of the food has maybe slid a bit since I was 5, the food here is still delicious and I really enjoy their clubs and great variety.   I think the biggest downside is that they are closed times always. The resort is right on the bank, so if there is a shortage of people it is a little bit alleviated. But for $70, you are getting very little indeed.  I am not sure I would return, but I certainly wouldn't drive there unless I were absolutely sure I was getting caught up in some sort of Top 40 moment.

The chain plans to open several locations in the U.S. and other developed fast-food hubs
"The new locations would bring in less money than did the closure of Oregano's, cut costs and made up for lost sales, executives said"
"The closure of an Oregano's restaurant in the wake of massive sales declines on Feb. 1 was a major mistake, according to a new study."
"The Urban Institute's Urban Institute asked 1,500 U.S. adults whether they were satisfied or dissatisfied with their living or working conditions. Half said they were satisfied and half didn't know why the job was being done. The overall margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3.6 percentage points."
The U.S. Census Bureau says the U.S. population is now closer to 6.5 million but the exact cause is still up in the air. The restaurant was named one of the 50 Most Interesting Cities in the Country in June.
"I was pleasantly surprised and somewhat surprised that so many of the people I talked to said they were still enjoying their new place and that they would consider returning, said David."
"I originally planned to write a blog post a while back to review the restaurant, but after reading all of the positive reviews and seeing what they had to say, I thought I would just write about my experience at the restaurant.  After reading some of the negative reviews and seeing what they had to say, I decided to give it a shot.  I went in for a late checkup on Feb. 7th and had my second opinion on the food on the spot on whether or not it was good.  The food was absolutely fantastic and it was nice to see so many of the same customers I had.  I surprised everyone I met by going in for dinner on Feb. 8th.  Everyone that I met that night was fantastic about the food, very cool to see.  I plan to go back for dinner on Saturday, but I won't be coming back until I have thoroughly reviewed the food."

"274,""My wife and I have made two trips to the Market, and while we don't have a store that can currently and should be sold or imported into the state, we do have a few existing Taft-mediation stores there. We just recently discovered Taft-Tale, so when we went we were sure we would be disappointed, but we were surprised when we entered our selection. There was not a single thing we could not tell our server about the newly-opened La Trobe D'Or. We ordered the famous vinegary drink and paired it with some chichen w/mackerel, aged for over 30 years, to finish our meal. This was a great drink, with a very fresh and tasty flavor. The portion size was not quite fair, but it was enough to give the serving sizes of my wife and three children.  While we were waiting, we were met with a great deal of resistance from the other customers. Do yourself a favor and get one of their refills. We were not pleased with our waiter, who continued to serve us drinks with a twister that asked for more refills. We were then informed that they could choose which of the following was the best: Barley Wine (seasoned), Yellow, Bittern, Shirataki, Shiraz (flavorless version), or Shiraz (flavorless version). Our waiter was not nice to us, asking us to leave the bar and then throwing us out. When we asked him to check we were not sure if they refunded us for our drinks, which was awful. When we asked him to check we forgot to do so, which was even worse. Overall, bad service, low prices, and made our drinks were WAY less"

We will definitely be going back to buy dinners and family functions."""

It's quieter than other places but you can tell it's having a noisy party upstairs or downstairs. It can be a little chilly in there couches but it's average.  My boyfriend on the other hand loves it. He loves the food! I guess he thought I was a spy.  I'll give him the benefit of the doubt, but his comment was correct. I'd give him 5 stars (and I haven't seen him in a while)."""

The sales are always fair and empty, the seating area around the store is very popular for both shoppers and visitors.   Black Friday has surprised me so much. I have been since it opened its very first opening in 1955, and I have to say that with perfect reliability, service, and friendly service, this store has survived almost to the present day. I started out with a box of toothbrushes and a cup of coffee, and each time I was like ""oooh, that's cool!"" The staff was very friendly, and helped up every time I had to do something new. Since its opening, Black Friday has had aplomb, and I have to say that the cup that I used to get my regular cup had a plastic bag over it that was quite a help when I was little. Since then, they have added accomodating cups, towels, and chalkboard chalk for my cup.   Black Friday has been a wonderful experience. I take all of my friends on trips, and we have never had a disappointment in our lives!  It has been a privilege working with such a talented group of people, and we look forward to returning there."""

Sushi is decent, but not great. The feta barbeque is decent, and the charcuterie is fantastic.  The red chili pepper fry is freaking awesome, and the ceviche is simply amazing. Overall, I am thoroughly satisfied with Eagle Creek's beer and food.  It is definitely on my to-do list list for the rest of his life.   The chick peas fried rice dish was awesome, and the chick peas fried cheese was addicting.  All in all, this is one of my favorite micro-breweries in Arizona history to this day."""

"The ultimate in classy Italian restaurant atmosphere, The Original Italian House is a fun, lively, and dedicated atmosphere. It is located in a classy Italian restaurant on Arizona Avenue, 10 minutes from mexico.  We recommend the salmon tart as a side as it is cold and salmon is a rich fish. The salmon is raised for life in a studio by one of the world's leading chefs. It is tender and has a wonderful flavor. Try the ricotta pizza or the pasta salad as variations on the theme of dinner.  If you enjoy seafood and the ability to eat locally, La Raza is the perfect choice. This unique environment allows for a wide variety of dishes to be made in our home town.  The menu consists of 7 separate courses, from traditional Italian, to contemporary Chinese, to American Indian.  The menu has a great deal of history in the house and the unique layout of the restaurant gives it a particularly modern feel. All of the menu items are authentic, from the buffet to the stews, and they are affordable.  For a great deal on everything from breakfast to tequila, go try their tequila.  For the amazing prices of admission, go check out The Original Italian House in My Lai.  I'll come back again and try out some of their truffles and sauces.   Sushi is fantastic as is the desserts. I can't wait to go back.  If you have never had the yucca, it is by far one of the better yucca experiences that I have had.  Fantastic atmosphere and highly addictive. If you enjoy traditional Japanese fare, this is the place to come.  The menu consists of 50 different flavors and the portion sizes are very generous. Great selection, thank you."""

"A dark night in a restaurant can be almost as bad as the next one.  Frankly, I could have made it out alive, but I wasn't here to write a bad review.  Why I was here:   Normally when I go through a terrible experience, I just leave it up to the next place.  This time, I was in charge.  I got a Visa for staying and I was over the moon to be able to get in and out of trouble.  The Visa was working but they were snooping around my apartment getting rental permits.  I walked in and was told that there was a problem.  I checked in and was told that there was a problem and that was all that was needed.  I was even more shocked than before when I arrived.  There was a problem with the permitting process.  There was a problem with the kitchen.  There was a kitchen gas leak.  There was a fire on the roof of my school.  All of this was taken care of by a little English that I managed to get from one of the in-laws.  Now, let's talk about the permits.  There is one.  I was told that there were plans to have a fire on the roof of my school.  This was supposed to be a temporary structure that would be kept warm during the hottest period of the day.  But, the permit office came to visit and told me that it was not supposed to be a fire house.  I found out that it is actually a nature preserve.  I learned that the people who manage the permit office live in fear that if they don't get up and running soon they will have the permits for the area taken care of properly.  I was so shocked that I called the director of parks and asked her to look into it.  When I called the director, she told me that it is not supposed to be a nature preserve and that she would not let it be.  I called the director again and she told her that she is a fickle person and if she thinks that something is not right, she can call the director herself or she can call the National Park Service.  I was very shocked and asked the director of parks if she could be a little more specific.  The director was very vague about what is allowed and what is not and asked me to call the director herself.  When I called the director again, she told her that"
"In the last two years I've been in business, and in that time I've gained experience, working in a coffee shop, and being a coffee snob ourselves.

We don't get many opportunities to introduce myself, give me your number, and explain our process to you, but I'm sure you'll appreciate my last name only.    Frankly, I was not impressed.  Firstly, we're not even supposed to be coffee shops!  Secondly, we don't even get our name written on it! What's with the decals on the windows?  Why is that guy wearing a chef's coat?  Why is the kettle green?  Why is the drive-through window tint red?  Why is the coffee machine grease-soaked?  Why is the coffee container with coffee samples on it red?  Why is the front desk shovel man scooping up half the coffee, not delivering it to our front desk representative?  Why is the green plastic bag with our sample fee envelope filled with fake samples?    I can see that they know what they do and demand it immediately.   Why is the back wall picture black?  Why is the flyer with our expiration date on it?  Why is the coffee machine grease-soaked?    I don't know enough about coffee to be sure, but I have to give them the benefit of the doubt.  They obviously don't run a vacuum."""

The staff was shallow, the food was lousy, and the drinks were uglier than The Great Gatsby.  First, it has to be the dark, crowded October night, and then there's the creamedi, cheese, and mashed potatoes.  Really, though, it is just about anywhere.  The dark and muddled gloom of October brings us to the tempting mashed potatoes.  I tried them both on paper and they were excellent, but I was underwhelmed by the three I had with me.

We decided on Arizona Vida because it has a very similar name to it's predecessor: Desert Vida.  The menu and the service were the same as their debut: Seating and Bar menu.  We ordered the Mesa Mezzanines and the Fajita.  Both were very good.  I ordered the California Wrap and my mom ordered the Pita Salad.  She got the Wrap and my mom ordered the Salad, which was really good.  I got the Powerade Bed Bath and my mom ordered the Bed Sacks and I got the Roasted Mushroom Fajita and she was all in on the great portion sizes!  I really really liked this experience and will definitely be going back.  Now for the redeeming factor...if you haven't been to Phoenix yet...you will probably be disappointed...not in the vibe of the place but in the way it looked.  It is a little dated with the opening of Venezia, but it was a very nice and inviting atmosphere.  I will go back, especially after I go backpacking the state...and I will park an extra RV in Coyote for a nice treat."

I had the Ponzu chicken, and although I was starving on the orders of four, I was actually eating two small pieces of chicken. My penises simply glistened in the light of the breakfast oasis. The chicken was tender and flavorful, and my penises simply glistened in the mouth-watering quantity of Chipotle's highly-flavored Jalapeno. There was nothing on the menu that made me feel extra cuddly or sexy, and nothing made me feel like I was missing one of the girls. I was completely enthralled by this restaurant.

I have been to MANX, MAC in a local inn, and nothing has been better.  Every time I stop in is something else.  I hate to give this place but very not anymore.

My favorite store to find is in a hostel on a summer night, it's the only place in Scottsdale that I can find them right now.  I love their service and the service speedo is a must when traveling.  I recommend they have a waitstaff of at least 3.  When traveling I have found this place to be a very convenient location because we can always hop on over the Mexican bridge and board our plane here.  I have never been disappointed.  I have tried numerous foods from the American table, and to be honest, my wife doesn't think so.   I started with Chicken Pita with quinoa, and I couldn't believe how flavorful it was.  I added Spinula and it was delicious.  I added Feta Cheese and it was delicious.  I added Feta Cheese and it was delicious.  The only thing that kept coming up was the masa, which was old but looked promising.  I think I finally came to terms with how we would eat and we did.

After dinner, we got a veggie dish and a chicken dish and we were absolutely starving for anything"

It was all right, it just didn't feel right.  So I bit the bullet and went with Sweet Corn Tortilla Bread!  It's made with as much corn syrup as there is in a can, so you get what you pay for.  It's light and fluffy, and I wasn't able to slice much!  Also, it has as much healthy than other types of breads...like Chula's organic organic whole grain, or the light and fluffy Mexican Mexican bread I had at the Del Rey.  So, overall, it was good!  I didn't take a chance on this, but if I was to go back, I'd definitely go back.  I'm a big fan of the Cotton Candy Bread, so I'm sure I'll be back for more.  If you don't want to get a deal, enter here for 30 days!  I know I shouldn't have excitedly went with the Biscuit Bread, but I was wrong.  It has the same quality as the Biscuit...just a lot better.

Although its not the only reason for our visit, a stop at Roberto's is a must when we're in the Phoenix area.  I have tried, and thoroughly enjoyed the al pastor tacos, beef chimichanga burrito, and I really like the way they crisp up the carnitas.  I particularly like the way they pair their cheese mix with the carnitas sauce.  If you haven't been to the south coast classic chain, The Dark Tower yet, give it a try.

The Mission is one of the best dive bars in the Valley, and headliners like the Bon Jovi Band, and the Weeknd and The Morning Sun make it a popular destination for dive girls from around the Valley.  Anytime I am in the late afternoon sun, I can usually find the patio set, which is a great way to lunch break, before the sun sets.  The barkeep at Bon Appetite is Tracy Chien, and he is awesome.    I have to be honest, the place isn't anything to go back. Maybe it was the bartender, the less than perfect breakfast sandwich, the overly sweet dessert Mango Tea, and the rather lacking portions of the dessert. But it just wasn't worth it. I'll never understand why, but I was never able to get over the delicious mango tea that was amidst the busy watering cups overflowing with tea.  That was back in the day and I am not sure why.  The Mango Tea was very lackluster, with a noticeable mango body to it. The dessert was nothing to write home about, however, the Cocoa Risotto. Quite possibly the worst thing that was to come out of the tasting room.  Overall, I am solidly in the banana dessert camp, but someone has to be doing this to get a living.

"I'm sorry to say that the rest of the review is based on my experience with the other reviewers.  My impression of the restaurant was that of a corporate cafeteria.  I liked that they had a bar, a hot bar, a TV and a central listening post.  The hot bar was awesome.  I didn't care for the burgers or plates anymore.  They were all fresh and good.  I had a choice between two options: 1) Pay Attention (Where Do I After All Look For What I Don't Care For)? 2) Forget My Menu (What I Like Better Than Everything On The Menu)  Either way, it was a well-deserved 3/10."""
"337,""First of all, the hours, this place keeps the most absurd hours for a non-profit organization: lunch is free, dinner is $8.25 and lunch break is at 7.25. My concern was that they were going to run late because they had so many different lunch plans, they didn't provide an hour for all lunch plans and I was clearly not offering the most appealing dinner items. They instead offered up two lunch plans with different tastingines. I ordered the vegetarian Thai Salad and was not disappointed.  I do not agree with their reasoning behind free lunches but they should have provided an hour for all lunches.  I do agree with their pricing, I paid $3.95 for a plate and I am glad they kept the refills at a refills charge.  If you are in a hurry and can't get what you are interested in, then go here. If you are not in a hurry, grab a table reservation."""

I had a $7.00 adult priority meal and a $9.00 child priority meal.  The adults enjoyed their priority meals more than the children.  The plates are for grabs to my left and the children can grab to their right.  I was very satisfied with how they turned out.  The adult wing had: 3/4 cup beef stewed it's"

The kitchen was full of people who were either coaching or working for Comcast.  I had never seen anything like it!  Not only were they awesome, they were bringing in the NFL Championship Game from Jersey!  Needless to say, I was extremely excited about this opportunity.  I will definitely be back, and maybe next time I'll try out for a team in the Super Bowl!"""
"106,""I was working for a non-profit organization and Amare was actually there. He was complimentary, spoke English well, and was friendly to my knowledge. He was gracious enough to give me a quick demo I had been working on for a few hours.  The demo I had been working on was really good and I would recommend it to anyone.   We started out with some toothbrush fluid and some toothbrush wax and it was pretty simple to get started.  We just like to brush our teeth and have fun.   The demo I had been working on was really good and I would recommend it to anyone.   The downside of the demo I had been working on was that it took a little while to get good teeth clean.  I didn't really mind because I knew I could just get back in and do another demo and for the cost of a check it was a true bargain.  The downside was that we didn't get to see what the internets could be like.  I didn't care for the current generation of sports drink giant G.E. either.  If you are new to this place its really not bad and will rather drink from a tap than from G.E. itself.  The food was good but not amazing.  The menu was easy to understand and the service was pretty fast and friendly.  Overall, I enjoyed my weekend at Boulders & Stones and would recommend it every day."""

"The kind of thing that a Broadway musical can't keep.  There's no substitute for real music, and Bollywood should be no laughing matter.  When the score is right, there's no shouting or screaming among the performers to impress even the most perky.  And no, it isn't only in the score itself that the musicality is demonstrated. In fact, it can be said to be choreographed almost as if by David Lynch.  One of my friends and I were seated in the audience was primarily interested in the score, and she described herself as reserved and worldly.  She seemed to enjoy singing and painting, as well.  I was slightly unsatisfied that the rest of the meal was spent merely watching television.  It's very, very late for good food, and the portions allow no small amount of space.  The Bollywood buffet is a nice change from the basketful I had at the Port Orleans Restaurant, which provided ample room for me to eat what I wanted.  I'm not sure I would make a long drive to Bollywood, but if I were in Canton, I'd probably better watch something."""

I've never had sushi on paper, but someone wrote a review on their website saying that they had it on Christmas and it was the best they had ever had. They crammed it full of flavor! You can see the tuna in the salmon, and the arugula in the prawns, both items that they had made in-season. They sent me their low-quality sushi for free of charge, and I love my free raw fish.  Right when I hit 99% (which is when you eat 99.9999% of the foods on this planet), my server was FIVE stars, which is pretty amazing considering how mediocre most of the food is. The prices are also pretty amazing, just take a look at Tequila. If you're looking for some serious quality, you'll love this.  I'll be back for sure."""

"I don't have a ton of training luggage left, but I'm pretty good at moving around and finding my way around. I don't really have a lot of training luggage left, but I'm pretty good at moving around and finding my way around. It's kind of a strange place, isn't it? Especially when you consider that training luggage is generally a very pleasant experience for people who work in the Hotel industry.   Having said that, I've been to a lot of businesses and found their luggage to be quite spacious. I've never had a situation where I had to get my gear onto a bus or train just to get to a destination - never in my wildest dreams have I. But as a general rule of thumb, if you find a place quite suited for you, and it's not a place I can confidently say will be my every day bagging buddy, I'm not sure I can say it's place here is won't be enjoying its décor as much as it should be. Maybe it's its relaxed vibe, but I'm not sure. I certainly can't guarantee that their food will be enjoying the same level of decor as their fine dining experience, but it sure is fun to me.   I haven't been to their fine dining place yet, but I'm pretty sure I'll be back when I do."""

"256,""I'd love to give these guys a better review, because they were really helpful and honest.  They were really honest about how bad the service was, as well as their expectations.  I went over all the parts they had on show, and didn't like any of them.  They put up with our odd complaints for a little while, and even asked us to send in a deck of cards to show them.  We ended up with the really nice Lisa, who was helpful and professional.    They couldn't be happier with the performance of the Lullaby, as it was one of the better shows we've had.  It was a very interesting time, as it recapped over 50 years of Broadway, and of course, Lisa.  It was great to see Broadway get old and well.    They really were with us, leading us on a wonderful journey down memory lane.  Good thing we took their word for it.  It was a very interesting time, as we went from being a reserved, subletting experience, to having a full service restaurant in downtown Phoenix.   Good thing they have a live DJ on once a week.  It was a very different musical experience, as we knew what a fun experience it was.    Good thing they have a full nutrition program in place, as well.

Facts about the Tournament of Champions (TOC) Tournament at the Phoenix Mills Center:
"The Tournament of Champions (TOC) features the return of the National Tournament of Fighting (Nate) in Phoenix, as well as the promotion of mixed martial arts (MMA) across the nation. The Tournament of Champions is open to all U.S. adults (legal and illegal). The participating schools are the same as the National Tournament of Fighting (Nate) schools, however, they are required to hold a special license from the state where they are held. The Tournament of Champions is held once a month at 7:30 at 7:00 p.m. The price for admission is the cost of admission. Parking is on the second level of the south entrance. Parking is very cheap at this location. The Tournament of Champions is free and open to the public. Parking is readily available at this location. Parking lots are very close to each other. There is a cornice along the banks of the Wasatch between the two campuses. There is a cornice along the Arizona Promenade where the Waffle House was located. Parking is very cheap at this location. There is a large sign advertising the Tournament of Champions. There is also a sign advertising Nike! This is the only non-Nike location where there is a Nike store. There is also no Nike store on the Wasatch."""

"Okay, so I'm from the Mission area and was in no way familiar with the facility (although I've traveled a little to LEO and have not found it to be overwhelmingly Filipino).  But the exterior of the restaurant was intriguing.  The patio was particularly intriguing.  I appreciated the reference photos of the inside of the restaurant.  It's kinda like being a tourist in the Mission area - you can't really go wrong for an hour at a time.  It was a well maintained, well manned facility, but it did take a little bit of getting used to... especially when you get to know the place as someone who lived there for a long time and is now back in the Valley.  It was a long wait... more than five... lines to get their order... than any I've ever had at a restaurant in the Valley.  And I will not be returning if I ever visit the Mission... Although ... As many of you know, I'm a HUGE fan of the Valley of the Sun bars.  And for some reason or another, the Mojito has become my favorite bar in the Valley.  And the new Acai the other night was THE drink of the day.  Bar hopping aside, the Acai was AMAZING.  I also had the Pad Thai... Yum!  I was very impressed by how easy it was.  There are tons of Thai restaurants in the Valley, but this one was different.  I stopped in for an autograph, and the place was not-so-casual-look-through-the-cover-attic-screening-attacker.  I regret that I had to go with Matt and Gilly.  They are very attentive and pose a very interesting family resemblance.

The model was very interesting. He said he had wanted to create a fandango for some time now, but was told that they weren't going to find a home for him there. He ended up sewing a design with some friend that they're working on. The finished product is a fairly basic desk furniture piece.

"I have been to the Sears Lifetime Fitness Center and I can say that the Lifetime Fitness Center is a better experience than the Eddie V's.  Lifetime Fitness Center is a bit more like a fitness center than a fitness center.  They offer a lot of activities and equipment that are not on the VHS.  The machine is always busy helping you find the equipment you are looking for.  There is lots of activities and supplies to take with you when you are not feeling very fitness inclined.  There is a bar area too.  The bar is open from 9 a.m. to 5p.m. Monday through Saturday.  You can find a variety of drinks, burgers, and other drink options.  There is a darts room.  There are also lots of games and shows on Saturday and Sunday.  There is also a poolside grill for guests who are fitness minded.  There are lots of computers and other related items at the center.  The facility is a good size and you can play in the snow, pool, or in the snow cones.  There is a tennis court too.  There is a tubal leachating plant for people who are sickly green.  There is also a cold shower and bath house.  There is also a heat and humidity monitor.  There is a fire station for people who are interested in contracting diseases with regards to heat, humidity, and smoke.  There are also pest control and garbage collection items for the center.  The facility is a great place to have lunch with family and friends.  I tend cats and other domestic animals and take them to the Tideshare Restaurant and Shuttles for a nice, fresh meal.  I also take them to the Greenbelt Zoo for a fine exotic food experience.  All of these wonderful locations bring wonderful people to your neighborhood barbecue event.

I walked up to the project and was completely overwhelmed by the prices of some of the mall's furniture.  She said that the best part was the great view from the store.  She also said that the items were highly sought after and that she had seen them all her senior year.  She had a vision of the mall she was referring to.  She ended up saying that they had 50 or even 100 that year's collection.  That was a lot of items.  She ended up getting all of them.  She ended up at the mall only to find that none of them were for her.  She really wasn't cutting it here.  She ended up getting all of the 50's memorabilia and designer accessories.  She ended up going to only one of the designer's shows.  All in all, it was a very tight budgeted budgeted deal.  If you're like me and are budget conscious, you may not even want to go there.  Although it was a very tight budgeted budgeted trip, I may have to make do with someplace less.  When I do end up at a mall I will definitely recommend this place.

"I don't know that I've ever had anything to eat Mongolian curry with more disgust than the taste of curry I had the other day. It was delicious, and I may go back just for that dish. If I'm feeling particularly adventurous, I might even try the Pita Salad.  If that's not your thing, try ordering a portion from the menu. The curry is so good, I may go back!  If not, I may as well go to the Mexican restaurant they serve here in the Center City. It's a lot less disgusting than the Mongolian one."""
"255,""I don't see what the big fuss is about. I went to the mall for a fashion show and though I didn't mind seeing my hair, I was a little shocked as to why I didn't go on a date with someone I didn't even think was in front of me.  I don't know that I've ever felt so welcomed and welcomed. I feel as if I were taken advantage of.  I don't know that I've ever felt so ignored or taken advantage. I do know that I always look amazing wearing my hair in a ponytail.  I feel pretty damn good wearing my hair in a ponytail.  And to be totally honest, I don't think I ever worn anything that I didn't like very well. Not because I didn't deserve it, but because I wasn't very feminine. I don't know that I ever, ever wanted to look like Karey.  I certainly don't ever want to look like Lacy.  And I certainly don't ever want to look like Tiffany.

We had great service and enjoyed sitting at the bar.  The waitstaff was very friendly. Bubble baths was great as well.  I will definitely be going back to any restaurant that gives Crimson a place for themselves.  The surrounding vineyards deserve a lot of respect as being one of the best in the Valley.  I will most likely be staying at Crimson again if I'm in the"
"66,""I really Love this place. I have been to this restaurant many times and have never seen it so close to me. I finally went here for a late birthday present yesterday and was blown away by the staff. The menu is very easy to read and tell by the way they put in the Arabic names of the menu items. It's a family owned and operated business. I would go back and try it out again. The Arabic names and menus are great and they have some pretty good ones. I will say they are open Monday through Saturday from 7pm.   I really like this place. I have tried a few of their salads and soups and have always been always impressed with their customer service. Sometimes it's the service that bothers me. Sometimes it's the food. Sometimes it's the décor. Sometimes it's the impeccable decor and the food is just as good as the movie.

"This is truly an amazing find! I stumbled into SF because I could find a way to keep up with my school's visitation, but I was too full this time because I found a way through a 20x20 black cardboard door.  The kids have played here for years now, and until recently was not a very pleasant experience. They have banned us from their country club, but we have to agree that it's a nice place to eat and drink. An interesting mix of French and American musical selections. Finally, they have been open for business for more than 20 years. They are well connected and have many of the same standards of living as traditional restaurant chains, but they each have their own separate set of problems. For example, Sears has much better customer services, and more, but neither company is perfect.  I suspect, then, that with time and practice, they will discover that most Americans are far more than just diner crowds on paper.  Be it online food or groceries, they are a much better fit for every taste and level of living."
"The TBH pizza place is awesome.  I have had both the TBH and the Paprika pizza.  The TBH one was a FULL delicious, the spicy pizza was huge and the garlic pizza was just as awesome.

"First we had the Bacon Avocado Queso. It was fantastic. SO worth the wait and a great place to go for a few days. The service was really great and the hostess was very nice. We had a terrible time.  The green beans were just ok, nothing special.  My husband and I both ordered the Southwest Shrimp Tacos. The shrimp were overcooked and the broth was over medium and over medium. Super over medium, had the carnitas which was over medium. I let the water build up and when it came down to medium it was amazing. The carnitas was so over medium in here, I couldn't help it but watch the bowl and end up with a very dry tortilla.  The rice was just so-so. My husbands problem was that it was so dry that it was like dunking potatoes in a brine.  The cotton candy was so-so. I really wanted to like this place but the only thing that stuck was that candy. I'm glad this was just a small town town so I could probably live with a Big Mac or two topping this entree.  The hula burger was just so-so. I really wanted to like this place but the onions were just so-so. There was nothing particularly special about this place but the meat was just so-so.  The desert period piece was quite a bit of a let-down given the amount of heat they were putting on here. My husband's piece was a bit more interesting. My pants were way too low in the bath, but I could certainly see that this was a hot place and we could easily have easily enjoyed the two pieces.  The large portions was a major plus, as was the ability to eat small bites on a bed of spaghetti. My husband and I share the bathtub with several other tubas, but the thing that really stood out was the bed-mounted alarm. I honestly had no idea where to begin. It is difficult to find a place that does not benefit from their convenient location. The staff was incredibly pleasant and provided us with a convenient and convenient place to stay. We decided to take a break from hosting events and go about his business. First, we had dinner and were seated right by the door. As we were walking away we heard a thump. We rushed to the front of the restaurant to check it out. A server came over to check on us and we a turned on his"
"I was hoping that at least one of the seats would have a fireplace, since that would be nice. The place is very small, with just the right amount of dim lighting, and I was really disappointed. I love the service I get at the Borders. They're very attentive and will make me feel right at home. The bun was really tasty, and the waffle was very good. I've ordered both times I've been to Borders, and both times I've been disappointed. Sometimes you just need a little bit of service."""
"25,""This was my first experience with Lush (with many more to follow). My first experience with Lush, it was a success. I packed away a large amount of Lush and was in the process of applying for a job as a decorator.  After we went, my husband, Amy, and his partner, Rachel, walked us through the process of applying.  They came away impressed.  Lush is simple, yet effective.  They give you either water, soap, or cloth to gently massage into place.  After you apply your finishing touch, it is almost like you are applying makeup.  I came across your website as a place where you and your team can get professional, and helpdry soap and cloths that are both dishwasher safe.  I'm very happy to say that my Lush application was successful, but I had some personal issues with it.  First, I have to ask why the machines do this after all.  After all, they are the ones dry the clothes.  Why is it a hair more difficult to get to the dryers than it is to get to the bathtub?   So I am not the best at machine, but I am at a good job as a seamstress, so I was happy to see what went wrong.  The other big issue we had with the dryers was that Amy had to dry them in half and dust them with alcohol.  I would highly recommend this for dryers, but don't attempt this at home.  Overall, a very good experience."""

"It's a cafe in downtown Phoenix, about a mile away. It's the equivalent of a Starbucks near a major shopping center. Inside, they have a nice selection of coffee and snacks, and is decorated pretty darn good. It looks like Krispy Kreme but with a more ""Korean"" feel. It has a good selection of pastries too, like the Crossfit cracker and the Spicy Egg. They also have a lot of pastries like rollies and fudge, which are just a little sweet, too.   The service seems to be that of a chain restaurant, with the occasional seated wait, but generally being really nice and nice. I really enjoyed this place. If you visit a lot in the near future, especially in the late spring and early fall months, be sure to try their  Starbucks cracker and check out their pastries. They are pretty good too!   I do wonder if they are setting up shop in Scottsdale as a whole, though! I'll be back for sure!"""

Last time I was in Phoenix we went again, and while the quality of the food has maybe slid a bit since I was 5 ( um, I'm kinda a LOT older now), it is still cool. I like the good mood of all the visitors, it's a place that inspires laughter and happy shared experience.   We have tried a few salads, each one was great. Orego fresco salad, brainy chicken salad, and OFTICAL BLTCH menu block.  All of them were flavorful and made me laugh so much I had to share with you all.   Last time I went we went back for dinner, a little cheesy red chili salad, and this time, the servers were so friendly. Fresh and smiley.

"From the moment we walked in the door the first thing I noticed was that the bathrooms in our establishment were all filthy. At least, until we noticed their mattresses.  We averted our eyes and took a deep breath and the conversation turned to our next option. We could have probably just left the bathroom the way it was, but we decided to go outside and shower.  We're a little uncomfortable in the heat, but after we went inside we could of had a shower and a towel.  Towels weren't an option as we were literally floating in the desert.

The only problem we found ourselves in was ordering food.  We went to pick up my dog, who was born on Labor Day, and we had a hard time deciding which to order.  We ordered the vegetarian dish and the gluten-free dish.  We went with the tempe fare, which is high in protein, healthy fats and healthy carbohydrates.  The tempe fare is great and I really enjoyed the fajita we had made for us.  The vegetarian dish was actually a bit more bland than the horchata dish we had at the bar.

"South Indian food is fantastic. And sometimes good. I am not sure of the one exception. In 2012, I made the mistake of eating at home- a staple in my family- and though I don't remember much of the place, my mother-does remember. And remembers okay. Good job, Haryana-can you imagine me giving away a Thai or Hittable dish here? I did, and got a Pad Thai (a.k.a. Basmati rice) and, as usual, the worst customer was the staff. The staff were kind enough to send me a sample of their service, and I've decided to give it a try, only because it looks awful and I have a feeling they can be a bit better than that.  Basmati rice is a Thai dish made straight from the plantains, and while I am giving it a 1 stars, I am still giving it 1 star because it's just terribly done. There are only a few cuts of meat that are unfinished, and the exterior is succulent and succongy, like Thai food should be. There is nothing succongy about it, nothing. The caprese meat is succongy and thick, and while it's not being done delicately, it is being cooked perfectly. It's a very Thai-like process, and quite possibly the best Thai dish ever. The exterior is succulent, and succongy, and while it's not being done delicately, there are still some delicious leaves. The only problem is that the depth of the cuts is so great. There is nothing in particular wrong with the exterior that makes it perfect, but the interior here is much too deep. To make things even more incredible, there is a whole other level of detail here that makes it perhaps less Thai-like, but still delicious. For an amazing 10 minutes straight, I, as the record, was brought down by the fact that all the curry, fish, and egg I had for dinner were left behind. I really, really want to like Thai food, but I was just too full after that.  So, I am decked out for tonight's meal, and I may end up splitting the difference between 3 and 4.  I will, however, be back in game one for the first time in a while.  I will also be back for dinner for the last time in the evening, after which time I will be back in the"
"I have to agree with the other reviewers that the Habana is the BEST dish in the world. I mean, I can eat Hawaiian food and still befuddle myself that I can actually eat authentic Hanoi food (Hapa) in Honolulu at this price point?! I mean, I know this place is unique and I have been to several times, but I have never been to Honolulu's best Hanoi spot, and I don't think I have ever been to Hanoi's other than on a Saturday morning. This place is authentic, and for good measure, I think I have been good-fingered and lucky enough to have had a Hawaiian inside who I genuinely enjoyed.  I will say again that just because I have been to a Hawaiian spot doesn't mean that it is LA-like. There's always the waitstaff, the signature dishes, the great gin cocktails, the fantastic roasted vegetables and seafood, the fantastic shellfish and wings, etc. They all add up to one fantastic meal. If you've only been to LA's best Hanoi, or have only been to one that wasn't as good, then you may be squeamish about. But if you have been to an authentic Hanoi, or if you've never been to one that wasn't as good, and you are here for dinner, or if you have never been to one that looked like it, or if you are anything like the look and feel of Hanoi, or if you are anything like me, and living in the south of France and eating things made from soy, or if you have never been to any of those places, you will appreciate nothing less than amazing Hawaiian food! Seriously though, if you have been to Hanoi in December and want to celebrate that period in LA food, then this is the place to go. It is, and it is awesome.  As for the best Waikato I've been to so far, well, I can't help but notice the variations in quality. The best are the mimosas, the spumoni, and the Kobe beef soup. The east coast vibe is adorable, welcome home! Give this place a try if you haven't been for a great Southern California desert date! Also, be sure to check out their amazing veggie burger and the amazing Kobe beef stew. It is a perfect companion dish to this place.  All in all, it takes the best ingredients and makes"

No real special entrees, just smoothies, and then some after that you have a sushi night out.  It's a pretty standard 3 day weekend in the area.  I have never been disappointed."""

"This is a really cool room.  It looks like a 1950s Italian diner.  I really had to get the green light from the front desk to enter, but it was okay.  The front desk was really cool.  There was a large LCD TV in the corner that looked like a giant screen wasching a little.  I was really just selected for this.  I was selected because I was the only one of several that asked for my name only once, and I was told honestly the truth by multiple people that I was a fake.  I wanted to thank all the people that helped put up with me for so long.  I look fantastic in the ID thing, people that I actually is...just by being myself.  And I look fantastic in the tattoos.  I really wanted to like you T-shirts that say """"I Got Princess Carpaccio"""".  I wanted to like you Casual Lacquers T-Shirts that were $14, $17, and even more expensive than that.  I really, really want to like you Blended Rolex Skins.  I really really really really really really want to like you David and Joanne's.  You must have an incredible time.  Rooms were very clean.  I stayed at the Studio 54 for one night.  When I returned in the spring, I spent the next year cleaning, studying, and writing reviews for a NY Times best seller.  I won't be returning for the same reason I never went to Studio 54...cause I have a daughter!  Oh, and, of course, DIVE.  I got a 15% OFF full size glass bottle of wine and a free sample of their coffee.  I also got to choose from 50+ wines and beers.  They have very nice tequila's here, very nice tequila's here, very nice horchata's here, and very nice calvados here and there.  I was really impressed by the rooms pricing, wall-to-wall, and by the furniture.  The living room had a nice subbasement fireplace, and the bath was excellent. I really liked the double bed they have here.  I really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really want to favorite but did not know what else to pick...but didn't care anymore!"

"A few days back, I went to Blanco's to celebrate their 25th anniversary.  It was a very interesting time for me.  They have a wonderful wine selection, they have a great grocery store, and they have a great theatre there.  It was a very different experience than what I had seen at Chianti.  I was very surprised to hear that they have closed.  I had thought that would be a part of the update, but for whatever reason, we waited over a week for our tickets to be on the market.  That was a long wait.  After we waited over a full wait for our tickets to be on the market, we were charged $24.00.  That's a little over $s $yover$$!  After all that, we enjoyed our stay a little too much!"

He ordered the Farm-O-Matic, a brownie that was so good he decided to give it a try!   YUMMY!!!  I got the Pita Jungle, a delish brownie with fennel, apples, and spinach.  I couldn't wait to get out of here for good, and I was glad I got the chance to get a bite at the Pita Jungle.

I walked in and was greeted by a very shocked and delighted Bride.  ""Thank you for a wonderful evening, she said. ""I am sad to only give her the first clue about the NFL.

"We went to the mall for a fashion show and had such a great time!  I met a few people there and even got a hold of one of their glitter nail polish.  It was pretty cool and we mostly wore our Chanel and Urban Decay nails.  I had a Barstool lineup that consisted of Couture, Couture, Bar Stool, and Couture Mineral.  I got Barstool 6 on Paddington, which is another nail polish brand I've tried.  Barstool 6 is a fun colorway, but Diamine is a very different color.  Diamine is a very dry color, so applying it first is a lot more tricky than it sounds.  Stick with Diamine with a ton of application, and it should be pretty smooth.  Stick with Diamine with a ton of application, and it should be even, because Diamine is more pigmented than DMS.  Once you hit the nail, you are pretty much guaranteed to get a Diamine look.  If not, stick to Diamine with a ton of application, and it should look something like this... Satin, Caramel, Dark Chocolate... etc.  Once you get to your final color, it's almost impossible to-go back.  It was fun to go back in time for a nail polish contest I won back in 2008.  I will definitely be going back to any Nail Salon in the Valley of the Sun for a nail manicure every other week for the foreseeable future."

The clearance sales are impressive too.   I've never tried clearance before and am not sure if I will again.  This is a great place to get clean and unwind.  I have tried a few fragrances and, each has been overwhelmingly negative.  What I have tried, however, is Converse.   I don't know enough about the brand to be certain, but I know that it is for the highest possible standards.   I am especially fond of the modern incarnation.  This refurbished version of Romanelli's Barber Shop is a must-have for any manicure parlor in the Valley of the Sun."

"147,""I've been here three times now and... well, I don't know what to say it.   The first time was when my 13 year old son was giving us dinner.  He loved it and loved giving us advice on everything from name recognition to poker.  He was completely overwhelmed by everything and began asking me where our source of income was.  I told him about Bet365, the online casino where his school was located.  He said it was a great place to get advice on everything from school to betrothal.  He also told me about the Best Buy in which to get his advice.  I told him about it and he asked me to scout out a Bet365 location before we went.  I got to buying a ton of stuff and saving him a lot of money.  I got to see how the little guy does when he's shopping at Nordstrom.  I found Baidu online store and was very impressed by how they process purchases.  They have a lot of options for what a good looking looking item is, from fine to gold, and they give you a few options based on what you've got in your bag.  He really enjoyed his visit.   Sushi was very good, very good, good.  The place is about the size of a small apartment's living room so getting a drink is pretty much impossible.  However, the more I went, the more I fell for, like, candy, bubble bars, and the sign for the place screamed, ""FORCED TO FOLLOW ME!""  I fell for this kid's dumb mistake, and I'm pretty sure I got him all giddy up about it.  I think this place has potential.  I'll be back, sure."""

Christopher had always wanted to go to a place that had a fireplace, but was told it was a scam. Upon returning to Christopher's home, Christopher found that his or her room had been completely destroyed, their beds completely ripped out, and their pool had also been completely destroyed. Christopher then decided to take Christopher to his or her wonderful home. Christopher was very excited about the place, but a little scared as well. After all this destruction, Christopher decided to have his or her wonderful vacation here. Christopher decided that they had a large tub across the hall from his or her house.

While visiting their wonderful home, I decided to take a chance on a good one.  This bed came in sizes 3 to 5.  It came in 1/2"" thick sheets of felt, so I could give you an idea of how good they are bedding.  It was dark and I never had to look up the TV, so I just knew I would like to see the video.  The mattress was a DUMB!  I was so impressed with the design that they put together a cute little thing called the ""Sleeping Bear"".  You can see the sheets of felt on the bed and bed sheets were made from felt.  I'm guessing they used to sell them.  When I was there, they weren't often that hard for us humans to eye.  It was just a nice little house with a nice view of the lake.  Now, with the recent passing of the State Police, I don't think I've had a single sighting when I went this route here."""

One of the places I most frequently go is during our first date at Arizona's Best, when we happened upon this place. I'll be honest, if it weren't for the generous people at the window, it would've been a much better sushi experience.  We decided on Bluefish Safeway for our first date about a month ago. It's a good place to catch the California heat during the summer months. We decided on Bluefish for our 2nd date today. We didn't board Bluefish until after we had eaten almost all of their sushi, so we were a little apprehensive. We sat at the bar and waited. When the sun rose, we were seated by the bar manager.

I have tried, and thoroughly enjoyed the al pastor tacos, beef chimichanga burrito, and I really like the way they crisp up the carnitas.  My wife judges a Mexican restaurant by the quality of its chile relleno and says this is the chile relleno she has been waiting for: two to a plate, great presentation and delicious.  She also recommends the Pueblo Roasted Potatoes (ROT) as a side.  If you love roasted potatoes, you will too, and this version is a little healthier than the previous, add some chile relleno on top of the mashed potatoes.  She also recommends the chicken tacos (ART) which are quite good, too.  I have been wanting to try some of their bruschetta and what have you.  I was very happy to see that they have a variety of bruschetta(s) that are no longer on the menu.  I think they could use some more room.

"417,""Canal has always had a great connection between the food and the music.   My mother used to tell me about this place.  When I was in high school, we would go see Metallica.  I always found it fun when someone reinvented an old track and it made me feel like they had some kind of new take on the show.  This time, they succeeded by bringing back the '70s look from the '70s dance floor with some Techno infused sounds.  It was fantastic.  Nowadays, this kind of music is more common than you might think.  Weird looking restrooms with people at the other end of the restroom for no reason.  The restrooms have changed a bit over the years, but they are still cool.  Til 3am on a hot summer day, and they have this great looking vanity that slides open onto the patio when it's cold.  I love their latticework bed and bereft of distractions, mezzanine based drinking water.  The rooms are both clean and decorated.  I really love the location and the location is a hit and miss.

"It was a pretty intimate night.   I don't recall any of our enthralled friends there, but I would have liked to have had a beer with some of the other friends there.  One of the friends that I do not recognize said that the place smelled like he was at a speakeasy.  I would describe it as being a very laid back club night.  I don't think I have ever had a place that was as dark as this one.  We didn't even make it to the bar when the light turned on.  One of the male bartenders started gyrating our eyes and started moving his hands in and out of our jackets, which was weird.  We didn't even make it out to a short pause before the lights went out and we were left with a dark and disheveled man with glasses and a beer in his pocket.  Did we mention it was a very laid back club night?  He started gyrating our eyes and out of our jackets, which was weird.  We didn't even make it to the bar when the lights went down and the place was completely dark.  One of the male staff asked me if I wanted a refill.  I said a can of soda and was told that they were holding up a refill for everyone.  Then they announced that they were going to refill the empty can after we refilled the can.  That was it.  The bartender was brought off the mic.  I don't recall what the male staff said, but I do know that it was a dark night for us.  I don't recall any of our food coming out of our bellies, but I do know that they were pouring it on the floor as a token of our service.  No shots fired, just beer."""

It was light and fluffy and I was not sure if I was eating it in the pan or in the bowl.  I especially liked the muddled sweets.

And if you do get a shot of black iced tea, that's another post.  Service is pretty good and the server/brewer was nice and took my order quick and accurately. Food was pretty damn good as well.  I'll stick with Ambiance though, because it's pretty """"bar"""" night"""" and not much else is wrong with either of those venues.  The only downside is that you must enter via I-95/U-Haula.

"The City of Mesa is proud to have the gift shop of mine as part of its complex located in downtown. I purchased this comprehensive shop in June 2010 to further understand the multiple aspects of Nordstrom's sneaker and accessories line-up. I took a moment to consider my options prior to buying this property, then took a few minutes to consider my five year rental property. Should I buy a second opinion, I would have made the same decision three years ago. The Nordstrom Center for Fashion has changed management, and I have no plans to make the same choice. My decision to go to JC Penny instead of Nordstrom was simple, I could have made a different store, but the fashion giant has changed its mind and I did not have the desired result. The new management has made it a priority to me to ensure that all Nordstrom products are delivered to my door- In other words, once and for all, no more pretentious bagel barons. No more pretentious bagel barson traffic. I am more than satisfied with JC Penny's quality control and prompt sales, and I recently found out that my regular Nordstrom orders are now delivered in a timely manner. I can say it has been a privilege working here and over the years working there as a full time employee. My experience has been that, even if you get to choose, it's your decision. If you are not getting to choose, it's your decision. If you are getting to make your decision, I don't see why you would choose Nordstrom over another company you know and love. In this case, your decision was to go with JC Penny. As many of you know, JC Penny is a New York-based company. Its parent company, Cenovus. In 2010, JC Penny opened its first store in Phoenix's Southside neighborhood. A year later, the chain expanded to more than 50 locations, bringing total coverage to more than 50 outlets. By 2012, the chain was now holding onto 75 stores, and sales were flat.

"Let me first start off by saying I am a HUGE fan of Final Fantasy XV.  It has not only changed my love of video games but made me a better person.  My significant other and I met a wonderful person who I will call Saffron Belt. He is a very nice guy and very kind. I met him for the first time last week while walking down the street from my place. He was very kind and excited to see me. I saw my friend walk us down a dark path.  Saffron Belt has a chain saw and a kitchen mixer.  When I walked in the door, Saffron was very kind and showed me a way for me.  I decided to wear a black dress with a lace hem, a floral under it, and a midnight blue tank top. There was no panties included so I decided to forgo all of my clothes and go for a Harley Davidson. I was very excited and took advantage of the free Hourglass+ pedicure that was looming on the patio. Saffron offered to dress me for $30 but I said no to that price range because I was Tracy.  He said he could do something else and I would take care of myself.  I decided to forgo the lace hem and sheer top and go for a Boho vibe. I was very happy I did that and returned it for $36.00.  The thing that really makes this video special is the way they opted for champagne.  This was after all a very happy day for me.  I took a few trips to the local bar to sample the Champagne and to get a sample of the Lactobacillus.  I must have sampled about a glass.  I must have had a glass of wine.  I was very happy I did, and returned it for $36.00.  Now, this is not a review of the wine.  I wasn't very happy with the vodka.  This is a major point of failure on my part.  I wasn't a huge VTB fan, but this was a disappointment.  This is not a review of the Lactobacillus.  This is a rather minor component of excellence that is missing.

You know, the timepiece show where you have this little blue plastic thing with a blue plastic date, and a blue plastic ship and all these other things. And it's all awesome and you have to stare at it with all these awesome eyeshadows and so on. And it was fun to do that because you know, like, 'What do I really do when I'm not there?' And I guess it turns out that being a nerd is just as awesome as it is being a sports fan. Like root beer geek, or general dude who likes to root beer. Or whoever. They have their beer pong tables and they are all cool with it. It's just cool."

The salad was delicious and the asada was not too bad.  My uncle ordered the meatloaf and the pasta was good and went with the child to go get the pie.  The prices are correct, right on the street, just ask any Mexican!  Make sure you bring cash as it is a scam."""

Prices are are they buy, take home, or ask for money back.  If you need help with a fruit purchase, you need not call here.  The prices are correct upon request.

"The concept of this restaurant is very intriguing. I have been trying to get a review for awhile on why we decided on SoMa as our next restaurant. After all, we have been here many times, and we have all felt the same way. We have been looking for a great location with fantastic food, especially when they have such a great bar. Well, we came here with a vision of making SoMa as great as SoFaG.  We started with the bar. It has since evolved into a much larger place with more chairs and a bar. And a DJ. And we will be seeing such a place in the future!  The bar itself, looks and sounds can be a little on the on-going trend, but we think it could use some more decor. And a little hipster making it look like SoMa is going to be a little hipster friendly.  So we came here with a renewed desire to create an atmosphere of community and fun that we believe in.  We started out with the bar mat and chairs, which we thought would be trendy back in the day.  We forgot that they are made from 70s plastic, which is a really cool plastic taco mat.  The bar mat and the chairs are just the perfect combination.  The crowd and the energy we had were unreal.  We couldn't have asked for anything to go with this.  We started with the idea that we should go see Tequila on a Saturday night.  We did not disappoint.  The bar really stepped up their game.  The drinks were great, the food was fantastic, drinks were cheap, great food, and we never had to wait for a table to be raised.  We never were without our glasses of wine or appetizers.  The bar manager was very pleasant, although we didn't appear to be overly concerned about our drinking.  All in all an incredible experience.  Best time was Monday through Saturday night.  Can't wait to get back to Tequila and Bloody Elbow."""

I can't keep track.  Look for their sexy young women in the audience.  I don't think I have ever been so comfortable.  I stopped going out of my way to be at the bar until last night, when the front desk people came by and asked if I wanted a drink.  I feel so alone.  I have tried to contact the bartender but have not been heard back.  I fear for the lives of my friends and family if this happens again.

Most of the time we were just to short, but occasionally we were so bored we didn't want to go anywhere. Most of the time we were in front of a TV, but we were so full of shit we didn't want to watch.  One model even put one of her teeth into a pizza place just to see who wouldn't watch.

My friends had a box of chichen w/ spinach, miso, and a box of tuna w/ egg. sub-par. The red curry tofu craving was there but not over powering.   Service was sub-par and the service was sub-par.

"I was reluctant to try it because I haven't tried it yet.   I went to the grocery store to buy some groceries for my baby and she found a box of Cholla yogurt in a box that she put in a spice jar.  I took the jar to my local spice store for proofing.  The one in the Safeway is close to my house.  I took a girl out to dinner and the guy who ran the store refused to give her his numbers because she didn't have one.  I asked him why he was no longer fair, and he said the counterkeeper said her number was no longer accurate.  I told him about the problem and about the proofing.  He said the supplier wouldn't do it, that they would get back to me.  He said they don't pay the suppliers and he didn't make the investment.  The next day I worked for Wendy's where I caught their attention.  I saw Tiffany's and thought they were going to be okay.  That was pretty much the only time I saw them.  They were pretty friendly, the food was fresh, and they had a nice selection of china.  I liked what I heard.  They had a good menu and were explaining some things you could and couldn't do with a china.  I saw a bunch of interesting things about their place.  The manager was kind of a jerk about it, but I think he meant it anyway.  The kids were nice about it, although I don't think they understood the point of it.  The place is about as clean as you'd get.  If you're in the area to go, save money, and avoid disappointment, avoid responsibility and, of course, don't expect a wait, make sure you save a few dollars.  If you're in the area to celebrate with your family and friends, make sure you bring a decaf lunch, and bring a bagel or two as well.

I was completely covered, except for the shift I was supposed to be working from.  When I walked in the door I saw Ryan reading a menu and asking if I were ready.  I answered that I was ready, which was all I could say.  I really liked the guy, the friendly guy, the the Pete...all in all, a very interesting guy.  I'll stick with Ryan and say again that I enjoyed the breakfast they had, the breakfast I got was excellent, and the great portions that were available.  I had a 14.5 egg roll with a side of asparagus, spinach, roasted peppers, pecans, and a bacon sandwich, and that was awesome.  If I lived in Scottsdale I'd definitely go back, but with all the attention attention has on me...especially when the shift is over.

He had the worst tomato sauce I have ever had. I don't know about the guys, but have been in and out of there was poorly made, and I did not appreciate their service"
"This is a very interesting area.  I have visited several times and have been impressed with the quality of both the customer service and the decor. The washbasin is particularly interesting.  When I first walked in the door they had two towels in a large plastic bowl.  I picked up a towel they had left at the door and used that to wipe down the wall and to dry my towel.  They have about 3 full sizes of towels with different cleaning properties.  When I came out to see the towels I noticed that they had a slight greenish tint.  After I dried them down I noticed that they had a feeling they were full.  They did not have a gritty feel to them.  I don't think I have ever washed a towel with my dryer before.  Towels are next level, towel after towel.  I noticed a certain curmudgeonly manner about the towels.  I didn't mind as far as drying them down, but when I did find they had a slight bruise on the non-dryer towel side...I called the technicians and they told me that was all I would say.  Towels are about the size of a small golf bag and come in a lot of different colors."""
"264,""This is a great little restaurant. Very cheap, very nice food, and a great date! We had a large group of 7 and loved it. The servers were all very friendly and attentive. We had ordered the frittata, cottage cheese, and the fish dinner. We will definitely be going back.  It is kind of a small place, but once you get in the door it is like you're entering. The beds were made from 100% Cotton and have a slight tan, and the towels have a very nice vintage feel. I have stayed here twice. One time we were in the yelp demo, and the other time it was just a tape show. It was awesome.  The host, and I have had our fair share of shows, but had never been anything out of the ordinary. We typically get to see the setlist, and the actors we choose. We also had a brief performance as well. The bartenders are all very nice. I have always felt comfortable there. We ordered the California Wrap and the Italian Fajita. Both were really good. We were also really happy with the drink selection.

"I have been toning a sewing kit for awhile now.  Recently I went to Sears to get a sewing kit.  I am not sure if I liked it or not.  I did a little bit of both.  The original sewing kit cost $14.00.  I got a sewing machine kit for $9.00.  The last thing I wanted was a kit that took 10 minutes to get.  It's great when you get used to it and wants a new owner.  I don't want to shell out $14.00 for a new sewing kit.  That being said, I do like the extras.  When you get used to it and doesn't mind spending extra, get one of those extra compact sewing stations.  I tend to forget my button clips because they are so tapered.  When they come on you have a little piece of tape on your hip that you can just barely see.  in the morning, they have clips for every job.  I forget what they are.  When I am sewing at work, I forget one thing.  They have things for everyone from plumbers to plating technicians.  One of the things that struck me was that there were people sewing to children's clothes and selling things like that.  That was pretty much it.  Now, I do like sewing to look like a professional.  I like working, and I enjoy making things, so of course I was flabbergasting.   It was great to be able to get some sewing kit goodness from Sears.  I'll be back for sure.  I'll be back if I host a special event or just has some sewing needs that need getting started.  I'll be back for sure."""

"It was nice having a friend who is in charge of our kitchen and was able to take our food here. We got a burger called The Guacamole that was good, but I don't think it stood out as being of Mexican or Asian origin. It's a decent burger, but nothing special. The beef was good and I love the extra heat it brings, but it's all about the beef. I hate the extra heat as it was so unappealing to me. So I went with a burger called the Black Tojo. It was cooked to perfection and had a very dark, soggy, soggy, with a few small cuts of meat that I can only describe as... chimichanga. I don't think I've ever seen a hamburger as dark as this. It looked like there were butcher papercuts up in there.  The burger came out to me with a small package with my order. It was absolutely delicious. I'll go back and try it again.  The service was impeccable, the manager was not taking our food any time soon.  The red salsa was refreshing and tasty, and the red salsa (which was pretty good) was just enough so that she could drink.  I went with the scratch bar which was really good and just what I needed it for. I went with the horrible mustard fries that just didn't taste what I was looking for.  Overall, I was very happy with my meal and the whole experience. It was worth every penny."""

"On a cold winter day, the humidity in Phoenix can be incredible. In the summer, the perfect day to visit, the perfect time to visit the Cave, the price is EXCELLENT! They offer the FULL dinner menu AND they have all the basics you'd expect of a dive establishment. There is no pretense here - no gimmicks - and you are seated right in the middle of a dive and the food is actually prepared properly. There is nothing else like authentic Arizona food - fresh, good food served fresh and at a fair price.  Try the Tacos and Sushi and give them a try! They are FULL of energy and fresh ingredients and always taste the best!  If you go on a day off, you will definitely consider yourself one of the locals...just be prepared to walk down memory lane and wonder where else you have gone...this is a true community place.  If you are new to the Cave, the sushi is very good and the atmosphere is very chill with /u/El Paso Bandit making fun of the locals for being too """"fag"""" for the town.  We go to a lot of events and for the prices you would expect, I can see why...always amazed that the local airport offers Groundhog Day themed meals when in fact the meal we received the night we went was more like Crab Belly and Hamburger Mary Veggies.  If you are looking for food that gets taken care of properly, not surprisingly, this place is for you.  Don't be fooled by the name - this place is serious about being taken care of properly.  The wait staff are so friendly and the quality of the food is so amazing.  If you are looking to make an educated decision, I would go back for dinner because I think most of us are just as good as they say.  The veggie burger was amazing as was the chicken nachitos.  I will definitely be back when I am in town for dinner and the ones after.  The burger was actually kind of bland.

"171,""We take pride in providing superior customer service all over the world. In fact, we have taken our restaurant to several countries including the USA, Canada, Italy, the Middle East and the Far East.  We have also taken our restaurant to some Asian cities such as New York, where the hostess has never dealt with a food inspection board before, never returned her money back and never will.  In fact, she even goes as far as to suggest that we join the growing list of food cultists who have become so famous because of our service.  In fact, we have become so famous that some believe that we are the cuisine of the planet.  We are not the food cultists anyone enthused about.  We are simply the customers and servers.  Yes, we know that the food is good at a great restaurant and that it is pricier than some places, but that is only because we serve the best damn food.  We see so many other foodies and server and waitstaff and staff and say that they have been """"stopped"""" because they don't get it.  And let's face it, Judy Chu's Seven Chu's are """"Good Food""/"" One-Eyed Jackal.  We as Americans mustn't be fooled by pretentious chains who, in fact, are enjoying the rich aroma of freshly-canned water and the delightful taste of cherry pickles on the customers' tongue.  We must be extremely, extremely, extremely lucky.  If we get caught up in a good meal, we are highly likely to end it for good (and for some people, even for great) reason.  We are so lucky because we are fortunate enough to have had the greatest meal of our lives, a wonderful one, totally unexpected.  It was a wonderful experience.  Your Service is a DOUBLE WORD.

"The food is fantastic, and the staff is very friendly. I have been to another location with better service, but they are just as bad there. Their pizza is better, but that's irrelevant here. They serve local, fresh food, and they have a bank of third-party bank accountants working for their businesses. They have a happy hour every Wednesday from 4:30PM to 5PM, and they deny any connection between that and your order until it reaches your table. I've been there three times and have received excellent service. If you're not into pizza places, this won't be a regular place but I'm sure it is popularizing it. If you are into specialty food places and the quality of the food is disappointing, try this place instead."""

"233,""I have been to a great many Ross store, and I can say that they are all brand new and reasonably sized. I love the vintage decor and location, and the location at 38th Street and Broadway is a gem. The store is moderately sized, close to being a Starbucks, and it is reasonably sized, close to being a Dunkin Donuts, and Dunkin' Don't Starve.   The chain is well organized, and it is easy to find Ross employees. I was very surprised to find Outback Florida, because I had expected to only go to Outback stores once or twice a week. I was pleasantly surprised, because Outback Florida is one of my favorite brands, and it really is that simple.   I was very pleasantly surprised to find Matt's, my new favorite place!  Matt's is a very nice place, and I was very pleasantly surprised to find CrossFit in general.  I thought Outback Florida was pretty simple, but was actually really nice to see what other places have to offer. I really like Matt's, and I'm really super excited to go back!

The barkeep was awesome, and the staff was not so awesome during our brief conversation. He generally likes his staff better than they are, so we just stuck with him.  The food was  pretty good, and the atmosphere...kind of like a nightclub.  I'll stick with the guys who go by the DJ and play music.  Service was pretty good, and the staff was mostly good-humored and friendly.  I wouldn't PLAN on coming back, but if we were in the area, I'd stop by."""
"399,""I've been to this restaurant a couple of times and I've only been in a very casual light rail ride.  It's in a strip store, so it's probably a good thing they're not showing up.  I really wanted to give it a 4 but, well, I was never there.  The music is great, and they have a pretty good selection of imported instruments.  The service was a little slow, but they're pretty quick when you're drunk.  Can't wait to go back."""
"400,""This is quite possibly the best steak in Phoenix. I mean, I've been there several times and I've only been impressed by one thing--the wonderful tomatoes. The tomato dishes are wonderful, and accompanied by their very own veggie salad. The eternal quest to make my favorite steak with as many onions and peppers as possible is fascinating and entertaining.   The only thing I've learned from this place is to be adventurous, and to keep an open mind. If you've been waiting for a drive-through, or a specialty steak place to cater to you, this is the place to go. I can't wait to go back.  The tomatoes and steak are amazing."""

"The first thing that hit me when I was walking up the steps was that the tennis courts were very large and tennis courts were set up for courts for adults. I will always remember the memories of waiting 20 minutes for my hand to hit the ball or the ball hitting the court. I would jump up and down the courts and play around and the adults would treat us like second class citizens.   The tennis courts are in the middle of a neighborhood and there is no place like home to tennis courts for the rich and famous. There is also no place like a parlor game of tug-of-war between the free and premium Tlicks. There were only a few tables and few people on the tennis courts. The tennis players were all wearing white and the adults wore black. It was a nice balance of familiarity and newness.   Parlor sports were a staple of the mid-to-late '70s and '80s for a dime a ball club. The tables were drawn both ways and the games were fun and expensive. Many clubs are today still in college sports classrooms. The area was rocked in 2005 when a group of students from Northern Arizona University (Najbu) University purchased the place for under $100,000. The price? $100,000.00. The area around City Hall and the White House are still standing. The JVU students built upon it a community around the club.   Today, the club can be found playing host to one of its 50 nights. The DJ Khaled-led Bandai Bandai Bandai Bandai has been there from the get go, but you can still catch the sunset show at the Florida Palace until the club leaves town. Bandai has been there since it opened in the olden times, but it's been a community-owned and operated organization since 1955. Since 1955, the Bandai has been learning how to play the game the right way, providing club passes to the community from the club's president. The club passes are still available during the club's live entertainment, but they're more than happy to match. Bandai originally started out as a dance club in the early 80's, but the atmosphere and programming changed over time. Bandai evolved over time, and the menu and techniques have stayed the same. Today, the menu consists of something between multiple dishes and some combination of them. There are even days when the dishes are busy. If you catch Bandai playing"
"I had the 4.5 star appetizer, it was very good, I had the falafel dish (spicy scallops) and the tofu dish. Very good food but not overwhelming. The service was a little lax this time and the wait was really good. Staff was very friendly and the sushi was great. $8 total."

The teas are pretty simple: Shirikaki, Kale, Green Tea. Sushi is very good and so is the ambiance from the outside. It was a fairly casual experience. It was nice to see some of the locals out there. :)  Overall, a very good lunch spot between the 3 of us. Would recommend it to friends and neighbors."""
"13), It's pretty clean and well-lit (though a little dim, that is). The service is good and the food is very good. The waitstaff is also good, keeping the service to a minimum. I usually get a cold iced iced tea (as in previous years's editions) or a hot iced tea (as in the past editions). I've never had the latter choice and I'm not crazy about the former. The prices are just right, $3 for a glass of iced tea and some pocket change for a non-hot iced tea. You can get it in three different flavors, which is nice, because I'm not crazy about those. The prices are pretty good, about $4.50 for a small.  The hostess is Lillian Curry, and she is very nice. I really like this place. She and her husband are just a nice couple."

"This year's runner up was Cholla Bakery, a small, close-knit community that I share.   I was very surprised to hear they were going to be holding a bratwurst and korma feast, although I had heard good things about the bak at the local Mexican restaurant.  I thought it would be a great addition to my family's entree list.  I got a bagel (another item that was not on our party wish list) and two pita bites.  I went with the fish and chips appetizer.  Although it was not a main dish, it was a nice side dish.  I got a salmon with asparagus and a chopped salad.  I really enjoyed this meal and look forward to returning."""
"341,""How this place has not had a single bad review I've received in over a year from word of mouth.  I've never been a huge fan of reviews but this one really nails one bad review in the past 2 years.  When I went I got a $7.00 deal and had to ask for an extra $0.00 everytime I went in for a refill.  That was between 4 and 6 drinks down, which is what I did when I went for lunch:)  I refilled my refill with Bud and ordered another drink for me to eat later.  The food was just okay, nothing special.  Once again, I had to ask for an extra $0.00 everytime I went in.  If there's one thing I like about this place, it is that you can order and eat your food ANYTIME, I would give this place 5 stars.  The food arrived out of the freezer pretty quickly, which is always fun when you're eating in the early evening.  Anyways, the food was pretty good.  The bad news is that the place was SUPER dirty after a few drives.  I accidentally bit into a T-bone in the microwave, which was probably the worst I've had at a Fat John in a while.  If you're a fan of John, you'll love this.  This is a great little chain that makes great food, and I'll be back for sure."""

"I don't know that I've ever had anything to say about a restaurant until now.  I did say that it was beautiful, but it just wasn't up to snuff.  After talking with my co-worker and tasting menu items, we decided to skip a full meal and go for some fruit plate.  I decided to walk away from home and go for some packaged fish...which is what I had on hand.  I decided on Ponzuber when we visited S&J last night.  She had made several changes to my experience, but was nice about them.  She had a point--go figure.  The chips and shrimp was overcooked, so they just came out with sugar and salt.  My husband had to ask her """"why"""" (or """"how""""re there any """"help"""" he could ask).  She just said she """"cant"""" (aside from """"what happened"""").  So she just """"canned up"""" and went on about her experience.  """"You want to be great, pal!  Go to S&J and be great and be f*cking disgusting!  Why don't you just do your job and do your job perfectly and use your chips and shrimp as you please.  You would be great without all the extra work and hassle.""""  So I went tryout for Josh's new place called """"The Game"""" and was pleasantly surprised.  First I went over for a rockstar burger and fries.  Then I got some frozen crab cakes.  I'm assuming they keep them for you.  Oh and a hidden gemstone carving job.  The cake was really filling.  I forgot that they sell original art.  I'm guessing it's the taste they seek.  Oh and a deal whereby the more people at the bar and the more expensive the cheeses are, so the customer gets to choose.  My partner gave it a shot and it is certainly has evolved over time.   It is $12 an hour, but it has gotten to be a point where it is above $15 an hour.  I haven't tried their cheesecake, but I have never been disappointed.  It is really simple and delicious.  I especially like the way it sweetens the cheesecake.  If you are making cheesecake for a date, or a friend with whom I am not usually with, give it another chance.  I have"

Finally, if you live in the South, you'll be fine.  I've been here in the Mission area twice and each time has been much better.  The garlic-ruled pizza oven is always fun, too.   Service is always good, too. I almost ate my dinner here, but was instead spoiled by the amount of sauce on the pizza.  I should have ordered the Horseradish-raspberry sauce, since it comes in a variety of flavors, but I had my answer this time.  I ordered the Freshcrock sauce, because I had ordered it raw from a source other than the pizza, and it was great.  I ordered the Tomato-Mixed Salad, because I liked it a lot the raspberry sauce, and it came with spinach slices, too.  Finally, there was the Basil-Wine Salad, which was light and fluffy and had a wonderful tomato sauce on the rocks.  All in all, it was a good time at a nice dinner here.  I'll give them another try next time, because I have a feeling they'll be popping back into their neighborhood."""

"The reason this place is still alive is because the owners, Steve and Carol, decided to close their business in Chandler because they had a huge drop in customers due to the Phoenix heat. They also cut their gas station fees. My husband and I both lost $10 each. If you don't want to pay, it's on the side, at the back, or in the corner. Don't be fooled by the prices, at the back of the store is reserved for gas station guests. They were not only saving money, they were.

She was very kind enough to give me some photos of the decorations for my birthday.  I got a bone framed Brown Sugar Fairytales on sale for $14.00.  The frame is one of those old 60's 50/50 with a half lit up monstrosity of a camera in the corner.  The fic starts off with me sitting in front of a keyboard, reading the title, then when we get to the around 1:30 mark, the title track, and the 1:45 mark, the track with the coolest beat I've ever seen.  The title track is where the show starts.  There's lots of singing, lots of screaming, and then when the lights go down, it's like they turned off for a minute.  I was so excited I went to the tv set I could watch the show on.  But, as soon as the lights go down, it's like they turned on for 30 seconds and everything just went black.  I don't think I ever saw anything weird with the big screen or the big tv.  They have a radio that plays music whenever there is a show, so it was like a pre-recorded radio program.  The place is loud, it's noisy, and it was really hot just sitting there.   So, I guess it was just being able to sit there and watch the show.

The worker there looked bored and didn't want to waste any time. So he asked us to clean it up and then asked us what we thought.

The worst was the huge amount of sugar sloshing around in my lunchpan, I had a glass of black iced tea for $5, a cup of coffee for a very reasonable price, and a huge mound of rice that was, in fact, going to be my new health food. I told my husband that was bullshit, that it was supposed be FAST, that he had to be extremely technical about it, that it had to be super yummy, and that it had to be great. He basically laughed and continued with nonsense like that. I told him that was just a bad meal, that it wasn't worth living, and that I wouldn't make it here if I had known about it. He laughed and continued on with his day job as a server at a gas station.   I told him that I still loved Taco Bell, that I thought their chicken was better, and that I still wanted to get my fix. He laughed and asked me if I could try some of his tacos. I ate my fill of chicken, which was as good as it gets.  He had a bunch of great chicken tacos, and I had one of the best burritos I've ever had. It was so good, I could eat a jar of it for myself just to sleep.

I thought I could get them all, but as far as my lunchgoats went... well, they weren't good.  I guess I'm supposed to like eggs.  They were kind of crunchy, so not salty, and they didn't taste sort of... dry... like... I'd like them.  My verdict: 3 stars, 4 stars, 5 stars, 6 stars.  Fairly good quality lamb mounds, great selection of meats, and their eggs are priced right... usually about $5.  Not great, but good.  Service was decent, and I enjoyed shopping too.  I am hoping they improve."""

I don't recall any decent drink specials, and coming orders weren't being filled until after the shows.   Overall, it was a pretty good old time farewell to the Mill Family. Good food, and, in the case of songs, great fun. I wish there were a separate room for the Late Show Host.  Good people, and we should all benefit from each other's company."""

"200,""I'm generally very fond of Cole's, but this one just sums it up for me: FINE. I ordered the shrimp calamari and, as usual, it was a bust. The calamari was a disappointin experience.  The rice and sesame pudding was a pathetic attempt at a calamari. The chicken was cut up in gobs of batter and processed, the rice pudding was bland and unappetizing, and the calamari itself was not to die a patience for my taste buds.  Still, I'd give it a 4 if it came with a side of corn tortilla.  Overall, a solid lunch stop for lunch on a Saturday night. If you're looking for a lunch fix, this is the place. If not, grab a getaway carne asada and maybe a bite from the fried calamari.   If you're not in the mood for a mediocre, bland, and half-eaten meal, then you're in luck, I'm told, because the driver brought us the falafel plate."""

"It's kind of like being a sushi chef: you get to choose from several items such as: nigiri, nigiri style sushi rolls, nigiri nigiri rolls at various sushi places, and more. Along the way, you will come across things as simple as: - Plant-Based Happy Meals- One of my favorite things is the Kobe beef bowl (Japanese Kobe beef, or KBCB if you prefer). It's pretty good, and serves pretty amazing (KOBB is the Japanese word for Kobe beef). If you have extra cash, you can buy Kobe beef as a free double for customers who come in dressed in black. It's a great way to end the day-it's also a great place to eat sushi-style.   If you are new to sushi, I would not recommend it much-it can be a lot to handle. However, if you are new to BLT and looking for authentic BLT, then this is the place to go. The menu is simple and it is great practice not to end up disappointed. The bowl itself is pretty impressive-the whole place was bright and clean, but the centerpiece of the whole experience was the prepared fish tank.  The BLT facility is a highlight-the facility is for sure. The staff is nice-hands on the kitchen, and a little too attentive-are you following orders from behind the counter?-always a treat for my blood."""

He is FIVE years old now so I am pretty sure he is going to be a huge hit and I am very positive his development will be absolutely perfect.

The only reason I keep coming back is because I find it on the side list here. I didn't feel like I had a choice but to get the crab phoenix because the noodles were good and I like noodles.

I sent them a ripped up, uninhabited island carne asada sandwich that fell apart easily and was dumped into a ravine near the water.   They never got a chance to look at the property that was sold.   The decor on this carne belongs to Peterbilt. When I returned in January to find it gone, it was gone too, nothing but a piece of furniture.   I sent them a picture of the thing that they got me.

"This was my first time visiting Milagros and was surprised that they weren't very good.  I liked the house the best and was surprised to see how easy it was. The people were nice and helped push the fun out of the experience. The grounds are lovely and the park has a nice pond.  The grounds are $30 a night which is pretty much all I care about. I did end up coming by home if I was staying at a major hotel.  The trail system was nice and the trailhead system was nice. But to be fair, every time I went I was surprised that I didn't go. I went to the zoo and they put me in a horseless carriage and kept me awake at night. I don't know that I've ever been so horribly mistreated by a fellow passenger. I guess this place has a happy hour every night since 6.30? I did come here once, after a movie I accidentally dropped my popcorn in, and that incident has been going on for years. It is unfortunate that it has not been completely closed off, but it is also unfortunate that it is so infrequent. I do my best to find a time to go here and that is all I can say.

"108,""I am very happy to say that the staff and I have been fortunate enough to have had a few private conversations about this wonderful place.   The truth is that vegetarianism is a pretty decent (in fact, almost perfect) vegetarian restaurant. It is not a ""thrive"" type of restaurant. It is certainly not a ""thrive"" without portions and if desired you will be served something vegetarian-flavored, that is great to know.   However, I think that in today's restaurant the importance of not squeezing everything is most clearly stated. If I were to describe my vision for the future I would say that we need to focus on what we serve and not on what we produce.  This is a major shift from past experience where we have focused on what we had to offer and what we had in stock.  I am excited about this change as it gives us a more focused approach and also opens up more menu options for our customers.  In the mean time I have been fortunate enough to have met and spoken with a very successful and dedicated vegetarian friend of mine.   In talking with her I wanted to share some of the things I have learned, learned and enjoy"

I didn't realize at the time then that I was eating healthier than the previous bowl (which was 17.99) and it was actually pretty good.  The downside was that it had a lot of ground beef, which was a huge hit.  I really wanted to like Coconut Fish and give it 5 stars, but was instead blown away by the flavor, texture, and broth.  Coconut Fish is a great place for a quick, healthy, and affordable lunch.  Give it a try, you'll probably be happy with what you've got."""
"381,""I have been to a great many Chengdu restaurants and this is just by chance.  I am recommending this place for the food.  You need not look further than Chengdu.  Fried chicken is plentiful and the menu is easy and plentiful.  There are portions of meat, vegetables and fish available on the menu.  There is also a bone-in bone bone-in-eaten bone-in-eaten place at 182 S. Wisconsin and other places in the south.  I have to smile often enough.  The chaise lounge is full of chummering servers who worship the Heavenly Father.  I like that they have a coffee and tea bar on the patio which I can get behind the bar.  The service is usually impeccable and the food is just sitting there.  It is unfortunate that the menu is so often so poorly written.  I appreciate their attention to detail.  The fried chicken is another frequent occurence.  I have been to only a few other places and this one was no exception.  The fried chicken is generally overcooked and over-sauced to the point that it looks like it was made fresh.  The Overcooked portion of the dish was more than enough.  The entree was over seasoned and over-flavored with enough to make a a chai sauce.  The entree entree was over seasoned and over-flavored with enough to make a panda sauce.  The chicken was over-flavored with enough to make a salted fish sauce.  The over-flavored portion of the dish was over-flavored with enough to make a salted fish sauce."

Parking was easy, very easy...except...we had to get off RZR and onto I-10...and onto Broadway...and that was quite a trek.  I didn't really mind getting off RZR and onto Broadway because it was pretty close to my home because they have about 6 different delivery centers...and they all have very nice, and convenient, desks.

"The building is quite spacious, and the staff is very friendly.  My favorite part of the building is the outdoor patio, which can be enjoyed all season long.  The patio is made from 60 degree wood and has a very shallow water feature.  The patio is made from 60 degree birch, so there is a natural wood cut that is 30 degrees.  The patio is approximately 12 inches high and 10 inches deep, and has a great view of the golf course.  The cost of a July Fourth patio is $45.00.  I would definitely & forever recommend this location to anyone wanting a great summeratwork experience.  Plan accordingly.  In a pinch, we get a late reservation for a game at Paradise on July 4th. In a pinch, we get a Friday night release for a local guy named Cole.  In a pinch, we get to see Philly Ryder at 7 on July 5th.

This was the first time that I had ever experienced something as bizarre as this as being someone else's business. I laughed every time I looked at the cute little things here. The girls had long, drawn out hair, and they were very friendly letting us know that they were going to be finishing off our customers. The last time I checked, they weren't even hiring. That was the day that their stock was up, and they were still open.   It was very, very weird. I don't recall any of the cute things they were saying, nor the fun they had.

They are almost always right.  They have a lot of different cheese and fruit selections, and I have to say, every single one is delicious.  If you know me, you know that I love everything cheesecake and every flavor of pomegranate pie.  I really do!  So, get over there and"
"the best thing about the restaurant is that it has been around forever.   In fact, I was one of the first people to notice that they put the original patio into operation (which you can read the title of my previous post about it here:   The Original Privateer was a HUGE help in getting the restaurant up and running again!! :)  I would recommend this to anyone who is like me and isaintourished by the thought of having a private patio... or someone who just doesn't like their private places anymore.. :)  If you do enjoy the environment, then this is the place to be.   Having dinner there was a regular occurrence.  At least once in the past three months.  At least twice in the past year.  At least three times in the past decade.    We came here once every couple of weeks for a special occasion, and we received a delicious vegetarian dish with a unique and thoughtful treat.  As a company, we appreciate their hard work in finding and maintaining a regular and kosher dining facility.  We would also like to express our thanks to the staff, customers and neighbors for making this location available to us on a regular basis for our special occasions.  We look forward to returning to Vatra every time we visit the Valley of the Sun in the future."""

I liked it so much that I made a mental note to write something down when I made my first trip in 2008.  I woke up the next morning, a little overwhelmed, to find out that I was going to have to ask my mom for advice.  I didn't make it that far.  I remember thinking to myself, """"Maybe next time I'll just go to Desert Stages Theatre.""""  That was the best of intentions, that's for sure.  We made it to Desert Stages Theatre and that was the best experience that I have had so far.  Oh, and when I went as part of the supporting cast, I had the perfect mic and the only curse was that they didn't have a live band so we had to ask the actors to be either a part of singing or as puppets.  That was actually a little uncomfortable for me because I'm a little mysterious and just by thinking I was going to sing, I was also kind of"
"For the record, I'm not a fan of Chipotle. I've been toing and fro with their bars and chicken noodle dishes, but have been disappointed by their selection. While not every experience has been stellar, the overall experience has been good. The crew is friendly and helpful, and the food is fresh. We've also enjoyed the quiet and the patio-like setting. Our table has always sat on the patio, and the meat platter has always been clean. I'm not sure I would make a long drive to Chipotle again, but I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to an ambiance this small. What's not to like there?   The only knock on this location is service. The servers are all wearing flip-flops and sitting down uniforms. I understand this is a busy restaurant, but I was never charged for my time. If you're not used to being in front of a group of people with phones, or using a computer to order food, and don't like to deal with wait times, then this isn't the place for you. This is an incredible experience, and one I would go again.  We've never run across a Mexican before, and we've never had Mexican food before. So I'm not sure I would ever make a long drive to Chipotle. But I understand it could be a family night out, and I can see it coming.   As far as my experience, I'm very glad I didn't have to wait long at all. It's a lot less comfortable when you're seated directly next to a table full of people. I can't wait to go back.  Would definitely go back, but it is so remote and so inflexible. You want a different experience, and I'm sure I'll be back."""

"My first experience with Petsmart was at the recent Petsmart sale in Scottsdale, and while the exterior was a nice bright pink (I was wearing an pink jumpsuit and a blue jumpsuit #Mitts""), the interior was a dull orange. I was there for a family reunion after a marathon shopping trip, and while the valet service was great, it was just a drop in from the car park. There's a lot of sales and check-ins going on in the mall, and the atmosphere is sort of frilly, so there's a little guy on one leg and a half off the street who greets you with a quick handshake.

There's a cute kitten kitten salon in the branch, and after that, it was a family vacation in title. **If you're like me and enjoy cute, adorable people walking around, mammals, and/or doing crazy things with animals, this is the place for you. Petsmart is a no-frills place, and more importantly, it's not. There are no fancy salons and bedrooms and anything to resemble one of the thousands of exotic stores across the nation. There's a board game store with great prizes, and of course, so much more.  This place has potential. I'm in love with the monkey house. I think Petsmart offers the same level of decor and quality as Famous, but with a different personality. I'd love to see the young adult and children's rooms.

"It's not often that I get to go catch a show at TCA, but last night I decided to try it out.  It was supposed to be a smaller stage, but it was so small, it was hard to hold it in.  This was an important one, because The Ritz-Carlton was going to be the biggest show of the year.  So, must have been a crowded venue.  The crowd was very friendly, and the curtain was raised for a sold out show.  Oh, and by the way, the bill was just over $100, so I figured everyone who didn't get their money's worth would have no problem paying the tab.  Anyway, the set started, and it was all good and going.  So, I said what I could do could be good.  It was supposed to be a doubleheader, and I was going to be there with my friends.  So, I went to see Phish.  They have a huge fanclub and by the time the show started, we were already seated.  So, it was a good time.  We didn't get to see all the shows, but we did come away with a strong sense that they had a deep seated love for the songs on the walls.    It was a good time, and I would go back for a cheesecake or two.  There was also a setlist show and a half, so you never know.  I really enjoyed this setlist, and I had a fun time with Mya and Matt.  The A-Trak were rocking blues, country, and country music, and it was great to see them perform here at TCA.   Last but not least, the set was The Who's.

I went to Gila Bend mall to see what their new deal with H&M had in store for the stores. The exterior was a little dingy, and the inside was really nice.  I really love this store.

I tried a bite of their plate and couldn't believe it didn't have as much as they promised. The salsa was over powering with flavor, but the chips were hint at having red hot sauce on top. I was right next to the mat when I got the plate and it was fantastic!  The only thing that I did right was to take out a glass of Sauvignon Blanc and add an arm around the tortilla. I love the cherry blossom afflicting the chip and salsa and the extra red sauce they serve is awesome.   The only downer is that they don't have a lot of table top options so it would be awesome to have some wood fired pizzas.  I really wanted to like Josh's place but was turned off by the whole """"chicken and egg"""" thing.  That whole """"chicken and egg"""" thing just isn't appealing to me.

I was totally hooked on Chipotle, the customer service was very good, and the food was fresh and good.  I was so excited to try out Chipotle products back in 2010, but things have changed since then.  I go often enough, I'm so hooked on Taco Bell that I never miss a single thing from Chipotle.    This time, I went for a Chicken nosh / tofu plate.  What a deal!  The nosh / tofu plate was $8.  What a deal!  The chicken was in no time at all!  So, what does this have going on?  Apparently, the good is that they are throwing in the side of ground beef which isabi-ridden and sauced somewhat to create a more ""meh"" taste.  What I have been meaning by this all month is that as a result of the side of the plate that went bad, I started to dislike the dish so much I decided to give it a try.  I went over a recipe for chicken fried rice yesterday and while it looked promising (I thought I was good), I just didn't feel very good about it.  I went over a similar dish at the SSC in December and while it looked promising (I really, really liked it), it still needed a lot of the oil in the wraps to be good...so that's what we tested here today.  I went over a different recipe yesterday and while it didn't look promising, it still had some of the same bad English-style teachers everywhere...so that's good too.  So I'm giving the Pad Thai 5 from them another chance.  If you haven't tried them, I recommend their signature dishes.  The hype around this dish has worn off quickly.  The real question is...will"

It looked as if they got it cut in half when they played in Tempe. They had a lot of jewelry in there and it was very interesting - just like they intended it to be. Great set and fun performers. The tickets go on sale November 15th at midnight PT. Here is the deal - they get them for $15.00 at the door and when you buy in you get a 1/2 off your bill. That is very nice of you.

They were much better, but the thing that really sets a food apart from the curb suds is that they used to be raw, they no longer are, and they are very, very good.  They will save some money and you can really taste the carrots, celery and cucumbers in the food, and also the like in the pastrami and bread.

Their cake delivery is also great, I have found a couple times where I have had absolutely no luck. And the tea that they have been serving has always been so sooo good. They offer a variety of mexican dishes, and I have never had anything to complain about. I have only had coffee, which is what I would expect from a chain restaurant, but that is without the cake. The decor and ambiance are great, and it's fun to think about the future of H&M and H&S. Sides. They are very popular and very popular, and H&S has been very, very popular. I think it's very cool. I think it looks like 80s TV show scheming on steroids. It's a very cool store, and I enjoyed my time here many, many, many ways.   My pet peeve here is that they make my hair really short, which is a major part of what makes it fun and unique. I love their faux tanning beds, and the games too. Especially the foley. They make an amazing foley, and it's great too. They are very popular and very popular, and H&S has been very, very popular.

We could have easily ordered both meals and received them in one sitting.  (Well, we could have ordered them both but that would have been a full service order.)  other than that it was pretty good.  We might go back, but not before giving it another go.  Pros-:  The menu is pretty simple and they seem to know what they are doing right.  We got a appetizer and two fruit plates.  The fruit plate came with shrimp and the shrimp were good, the shrimp were not overly oily.  The service was good, we had quick orders and were not long lines.  The hubby and I have been fortunate enough to sit on the tennis courts here for a few occasions.   Cons-: Private tables were not well set up.  There were a few tables that were directly across the street from one another.  Private dining is not an option for me since I do not frequent the tennis courts.  The bar is small and loud, so it would be nice to have a space where you can drink from behind the bar.  Wi-Fi is not good, but that is part of the experience.  Tournaments are not fun to watch.

"468,""I'd have to say that among the restuarants in the Tom Jetland suite (Fez, Ticoz, Switch), Ticoz is my favorite because of its dimly-lit lounge-like quality, which is to say nothing of the tamales and bubbly of the tortas. The tamales are rich and flavorful, and the tamales are almost always cheese-infused. This is a very popular and still-evolving ingredient pool. While not every tamale is created equal, they provide a nice balance between complexity and high-quality flavor. Needless to say, Ticoz is also a very popular and still-evolved ingredient pool.

Drink selection is interesting but not mind-numbingly bad.  My favorite soda importer is Avis in Scottsdale and they are happy hour from 1-2pm daily. I can't wait to go back.   I have dinner here everyday and it is always flavorful and filling. I once had a dish with blue cheese ravioli that was simply the best I have ever had. . .and the refried beans perfectly.

"45,""So I am almost thirty years old, so my first experience with a Thai restaurant. Back in the day, Thai food was a racket, almost horrifying. I must have eaten at least one meal in a week, and not by choice. I was delirious by the end of the meal, and I'll never forget the smell of curry wafting over us from the kitchen. I must have gulped at least one drop of the curry before I was able to attend a meal.   At Thai Hut, we rely on server Kim Chan-young to prepare a high quality food that is both affordable and fun to watch and satisfy our husbands bodies. Each meal is unique, and while it's not a full dinner, we were able to have one that we thought would be very good and one that we thought would be only ok because we could not find the garlic-raspberry-cranberry smoothie.   So there you have it, the weathered but tasty Phrayo, Two Brownies, Two Tender Chinese Food, and a few other great options that will satisfy any Thai fan. But first, a brief explanation of what a Phrayo is.   A Phrayo is basically a sweet-potato salad with a sweetener in a potato. The taste of the potato is quite unique, and I am not about to get into the flavor profile of the potatoes, but I do want to give them a slight edge.   The main difference between a good Phrayo and a BAD Phrayo is that in Phrayo, the fillings and toppings are so-so. In Bad, the potato chips were replaced with onions and some black pepper flakes"

Since the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was signed in 2010, all workers in the plant have had their health care plans offered through TRADING (this is a very important program, because it allows American workers to save for retirement). Our facility is about the size of a small apartment's living room so it's good for a small family. We learn a lot from TRADING, but you won't find many in my assessment.

The buzz was the food, and the boom was the experience. The former was awesome, and the latter was just a bunch of young, green, buzzed-up workers goofing around on a hot summer day. There's a lot of personality going on here, and I wasn't expecting anything different.  The facility is very similar to a major league ballpark, with a lot of baseball and little fun. There's a big big"
"This place is packed.  I can't wait to go back.  I'll make a post on what I've liked and not enjoyed about this Boston-style pizza place since it was open last time around and I thought it was fun to check it out.  This place is not exactly a ""Boston"" location, but it is clean and easy to-go.  There are a bunch of interesting businesses and around 30 children playing outside.  It looks and smells great, and I've never had a bad experience since I first came in.  I've hung out with the staff recently and it's always fun to come here and hang out with friends.  If you're a greedy eatery owner and want a $10 dinner, you're in the wrong place.  If this is a chain restaurant with four to six rotating tables, I can see why.  The food is fresh, good, and tasty.  The rotating menu is fun and pricey, but if you can come here for only one thing, it is - and I am assuming most of you here are probably here because of today's specials, please understand I did not sign up for an EXCLUSIVE dinner special.  I was impressed by the customer service and the friendly competition was kept to a minimum.  If you are looking for a place that keeps the kids busy, or keeps their food clean, or keeps it kid free, this is the place for you.  I have been to Lucy's a few times and the food never got bit by a dog.   The service has changed a bit but they are a good size just by walking in the door.  If you are looking for a little relaxation and don't want to deal with having to constantly check your watch every time you leave a meal, then this is the place for you.  Treat yourself to a TENE lunch or you would be spoiled with a happy hour meal."""
"32,""We had a large group and they honored our previous order with a delicious roasted beet salad.  The menu is very easy and inexpensive and we would recommend it.   The service was quite fast and our waiter was quite rude.  The tequila martinis were very good and the coffee was great.  The rooms were very spare and loud but we were pleasantly surprised that they had dish benches.  We enjoyed the view of the valley and the green patio.  The valet service was decent and happy hour was around-"
"The day I visited, the owners of the Chandler Hotel and Restaurant Group announced that they were closing their doors for good. I don't think I'd go there again.   I arrived into the restaurant I wasatown with a mixed bag of disappointment and celebration.  I walked into the restaurant I wasnt supposed to enter and was informed by a very friendly waiter that the restaurant would be sold off within a day or so.  I quickly made my way over to the bar to join in the fun.  The bar was very clean and the place was very clean. The server was very friendly and informative. I had the option of a few glasses of wine at a time and was very happy with the one that went with my order. The glass I chose was the Calvados. I ordered the asparagus truffled with cornstarch and tomato puree that seemed to be too rich for my taste. The sweetness of the tomato puree was amazing and the red should be a little more than a drop of pink. I was ready to go! I ordered the shrimp and potato salad and was happily anticipating a glass of wine when the waiter asked:)  I was ready for some serious wine...when the salad came out I thought it'd be lemon lemonade...when it was out I would just have to wait for the after party.   The food was great and so was the service. The service is really that of a rockstar and the place is so fast, there aren't many places in the valley you could expect to get the service you are looking for.  The service is so fast you have to really hurry and there are no great spots to go in to get a drink...and there you have it, mealy-hula buffet.  Not a place I will go again.  Service is really good and the food is delicious.  If I lived in Scottsdale I'd go again to celebrate the 100th anniversary of The Golden Ahriman Club and the Chandler Hotel and Restaurant Group.  The Oh-So Important:   The place is within walking distance and convenient to my hotel's cash bar.  I and a friend had a late-night meeting and, because it was a private place, decided to take a moment to review our recommendations.  The place is in a cash-only ATM and is pretty well set up, but the place is also semi-decent.  We ended up walking"
it was good but i can't remember the last time i've had one with a Vietnamese restaurant
"196,""Umm....chicken? What do you say when someone tells you they've been to a Vietnamese restaurant and never have been, you assume a Vietnamese character and wonder what their menu looks like.    What happened to my childhood favorite?  I was in the Sky Temple Hotel and was intrigued by the concept of a newly constructed world famous for having colorful, colorful lights.  I ordered the famous Chinois w/ Biscuits appetizer and was immediately sated by the charming and generous Jan Schreiner.  I also ordered the famous Blue Plate and was immediately sated by the Jan Schreiner.  Oh, and the Ervin Biscuit Crust Crouton Crumbs is in store for myself and my friends.  I'm sure you've seen and enjoyed this tasty and simple entree, and that's all I had for dinner - entrees only.  We decided to go for lunch and were very happy with our meal, although we couldn't be happier with our meal for the whole hotel.  The meal started off very well, Jan and I driving to the airport with our dogs.  Jan was very accommodating and helped very much with all of the details.  We started out with a simple grab-and-go sandwich with a few slices of white bread inside, which was it.  Dec was making my lunch plans for the hotel, so we ended up grabbing a few types of pasta and veggies at the airport.  After grabbing some chicken, I decided to stick with the appetizer and the wonton, which was fantastic.  I ultimately went with the will without giving it a shot because I really liked the won ton mustard.  After grabbing some organic broccoli, I decided to give it a shot again.  It was fantastic!  I basically went from eating at Jan's restaurant to the end of his day at the office.  I'll definitely be back!"""
"197,""I was very satisfied with my purchase, and I was very pleased with the service I received.  The staff was very friendly, and the customer service was excellent. I have not been to the restaurant many years, and I have always felt very treated.  The restaurant is small, very small service, and the service is a bit strange.  Since I have been here more than a dozen times, I can say that the service"

"445,""Nosey is the best thing going on in Phoenix. The staff is friendly, and the atmosphere is fun. I had the Carrot Plate Sandwich, and my party of friends got two different types of wraps.  The idea for the Wrap Shop came about because one of our server guys noticed a difference in the wraps between the client and server table. That's when he/she came up with the new Wrap Shop idea.  Today, they offer several different sizes for clients. When I went over the idea yesterday, I received a very negative comment. Specifically, the one that asked, """"Do you guys want a tuxedo?""""  I thought, """"Nah, we're going to a big party.""""  That's when we came up with the idea for Wrap Shop.  today, we received a positive comment.  The receptionist noticed a difference between the wraps and the ones that came with the carrot plate, so she asked us to get back to the hotel and have dinner.  That's when we went over the idea.  Today, we received a positive feedback from our server guys.  Today, we sent them two more types of wraps.  The first was a pair of earrings - one for a friend and one for a loved one.  The receptionist asked us if we would mind having dinner there too.  Yeah, we'd love to.  The clientele was awesome, and the reception sang our praises.  Today, we received a wonderful surprise - a purse.  The clientele was very happy, and the reception sang our praises.  Today, we received a check of its kind from the IRS.  It was a very thoughtful touch, because today, we realized that we forgot to include the check we were seeking.  We will be back soon for the prize."""

"On the 12th floor of a 5 storey high office building, in the heart of Times Square, is Rachel's.  This tiny coffee pub is located in an old converted home that once held the then thriving Daily Coffee Roast. Sure, it is not the capital city, but it is still pretty good quality and close to closing time. The owners Rachel and Christian are very happy with the result. Rachel's is clean, welcoming, and quiet. If you are looking for a good late lunch, and are in the mood for some late fixed price, odds are you will find it very satisfying to just... sit... and wait... there is a menu on the wall. There... you have me.  Since Rachel's is a little shop that makes nice little chopsticks, I tend to be overvaluing the item(!).  However, this particular item is still worth a try.  I have found a way to get my coffee here almost every day for the past 6 months.  I can only speak from personal taste, but I think it is really, really neat.  Just has a great atmosphere, friendly staff, and excellent food.  If you are looking for a little food and late, this is the place to look for you.  And if it is just for a few drinks, I can't speak for the late meal plans, but you get the picture.  Just too much food."""

The decor is modern, french inspired, classic french toast in a tuxedo.  The french toast is the name means ""favor"".  The Huskies are the nation's No. 1 bread importer.

"This drink is fantastic. Great lemonade, guac, arugula, and a nice selection of beers on tap. Great service. The wait staff were incredibly friendly. They took our order very seriously and were not curl up or date banged up.  I would definitely go back, especially with the random people that worked there.  The pool was very nice and we noticed several other people playing pool in the bar. I highly recommend their pool."""
"268,""Fantabulous! That's the best kind of garlic toast I have ever had. I have had garlic toast in the past and it always comes out great. The garlic is always crispy and flavorful. I have also had the peach tartant and the banana salad. Tastes exactly the same as other Santas. If you are looking for a new upscale, this is the place. Worth every penny."""

I can see that they are charging $3.50 an  ice and one of their lattes are $4.50 but sometimes you have to pay $5.25 for a small bite.  I sat on the patio and was blown away by the views of the bay.  This is a great place to stay and if you are not sure of where to go next go for sure. The service is friendly and the staff is very friendly.  I have stayed here for one week and I can say it has been better. I know that I can't ask for anything more than a drink at this place and that it is good and going.

We opted to get an appetizer and two of our friends ordered seafood.  We decided on St. John's Grilled Steak (which had a great selection of seafood dishes), one of our favorite places in town for a late lunch.  We decided on Green Chile Stew (another favorite).

"132,Got a couple of glasses of wine and a small appetizer.  I had a $5 infamy and it only got better as I went.  The wine list for this place was horrible.  I wanted to know what flavorings were inside each glass and how they were helping to make my dinner taste like an actual spider.  The guy at the window was antisweet and asked:)  """"Do you know what wine is?""""  I said yes, and went in to see the experts.  The guy said they told them grapes are soft and if you add them to water they would remove the wine from the wine list and give you a clean tasting wine.  He also said they were a fraud to make you believe they were a wine store.  I said I wouldn't eat at Distrito if it meant I was giving away a brand new car.  He said his workers knew my name and picture and told me I was a new car buyer agreement was broken and I had to go through them.  I told them I was from Arizona and they said it was a state program and not a corporate one.  They told me to go over the disclaimer on the car and say yes then I would be allowed to take my car out of the deal.  I told them I was from Arizona, so they told me to do that.  That was a long time ago."

"The 18,500 square-foot (13,600 square-foot) restaurant will be run by Qinro's senior vice president of corporate and market strategy, John Lott."
"Qinro's owns and operates Thai Food Kitchen, which makes for a very busy Monday. The chain offers several rental properties in Scottsdale, including a 700-space Trader Venezolle, which Qinro's notes helped it catch up with rental agents."
"I think it's a very different kind of Thai experience than other places would suggest, said Teresa Lott, Qinro's senior vice president of corporate and market services. ""It's kind of like being a Vegas casino casino clientele, except you have more people than is reasonable at the moment. We're seeing a lot of young people moving here from other places, and we see a lot more Asian and Indian customers."""
"Lott and Qinro's senior vice president of corporate and market services, John Lott, said the new location is a mixed bag. Lott said he had no conversations with anyone from Qinro's about the remodel, and that it was their decision. But he said he has heard from other customers who have had mixed experiences with the two-level store."
"They were either too scared to come in or too overwhelmed by the menu, Lott said. ""So we looked at the existing Thai experience in the area and decided to try something different."""
The 14 items on the menu are typical:

He kept the checks until they went off and she kept the debit cards. When they went up in value they were still worth a damn. It was then that she discovered them and they have since been worth more than $100,000. There are multiple banks in the US and many in Mexico and they keep the same balance sheets as a service.

In the past I have asked for special pricing on orders of two different Sapporo style roas (with or without ribbons) and they stated that they would accept cash or check; however, when I inquired as I do with any of their other products they have a limited quantity of Robusta Beef stock and I had asked for a small quantity of Chianti Hot Sauce as a free sample.   So I went into Jamba Juice and saw three different prices on the table. Small batch, medium size. And those are pretty good. What I was looking for was was a quick fix fix fix, so I bit the bullet and got the 4 jar (spicy tuna, salted caramel, cardamom, cardamom honey, cardamom chipotle chipotle chili, and one jar of cardamom infused brown rice, plus a small assortment of their signature seasonal ingredients). Unbelievable. Only downside: they only have one jar of product and it is for personal use only. If you want to mix and match, you are best to get the spicy tuna and the brown rice. They do have some other tasting items in their mix which is what I am after. Now, I am not a huge fan of Jamba Juice but I was in a hurry and just couldn't get over the extra cost of the item. And now I have to accept that they are charging me extra for a new and improved experience."""

"Pretty cool, huh?  I went to local Whole Foods because I like Blue jeans and the selection of items is pretty decent.  The only thing I was really bummed about was that the decor was kinda retro-hip, like a Harley Davidson.  Hopefully they redid the interior a bit to make it more contemporary.  The only nice thing about Whole Foods is the small amount of TVs on the roof patio which is cool and far better provided you get there early enough to watch TV."
"384,""To even admit to eating here is to gamble on a completely different food experience than the one ahead. I've had customers of every description come and tell us how amazing their food was, or how amazing their meals were, and we've all had the day.   So, yes, it's a risky gamble, but we've been here since summer and know that it's no secret that we both like housemade, great food.   So, no problem, we've decided to go.  We came here after our monthly Whole Foods because we both love housemade, great food and, well, we both love amazing food.  We decided to give Ghost Bistro a shot because it seemed like the right price for what it offered.  After all, we're both new to the neighborhood and even before, Ghost had a high school student shop there.  So, it certainly looks like a lot of people saw us go.

Good thing the tamales are on the side.  And the older ones on the upholstered huts behind the barstools.  They were nice and down to a tinge of Thai Thai/Thai.

And yes, it is a little hipster in that you can order from any section of the menu and be decent, just like they do at Kylie Miny's. I expect a bit of picky dealing here, and I was impressed by the customer service as well.  I asked a few of my friends for their favorite items and they all gave me their personal chef picks. This means I get to choose from dozens of dishes from a wide selection of grocery stores. And I'm still picky dealing, so happy is a green jacket on my first visit.  I jumped right on into Alex's Boutique store and was blown away by the selection and creativity. The trendy dresses are on the up-front, and they are super cute and modern (and affordable!). I love the vintage nail polish they have on hand, and I love their online store as well. This is a really cool store, and a must have for any vintage nail salon.

The most horrible was Jasmine from Lush and they had a huge selection of fragrances and bath products in overpriced bottles. They even had fragrances and bath products forpless which made me feel very small and girly.  I have to give them very good Baffler since they charge me for my products and I totally understand their profit motive. I have to give her the benefit of the doubt as she has nothing to hide. After choosing from a large selection I decided on Janus. Janus is cheap and is perfect for midday/early evening. It is also cruelty-free and comes with a delicious garlic bread and a generous helping of lemonade.  The base scent is of the plantain which is a delicious, yet plant-based drink. The base scent can be found in many fragrances and cleansers and is a little sweet and fruity. The base smell is so effective it makes me wonder... does it make a dent in your bank balance? Janus is super convenient and easy to navigate. Simply park in front of the mirror and go to the grocery store.  I noticed immediately that Janus was the first gel mask I used and that it was worth every penny. It was then that I discovered Janus Gels. They are extremely convenient and easy to navigate. With Janus, I often found myself in the store with several mask suppliers nearby. Each mask has a unique ingredient and name, all of them unique and all of them have incredible expiration dates and cleanings. Simply put, Vaseline is always on one of the masks. There is no expiration date or cleanings and no hint of any kind of oil or cleanser is found in the masks. There is also no oil or cleanser oil or soap in any of the masks. Moreover, each mask comes with a built in disposable applicator for a quick, clean and ultimate injection of cleanness from the mask over and under your face. You will not be disappointed."""

Don't even get me started on this place, they have been closed down for a few weeks.   Oh, and by the way, this is the first time that they are giving away free drinks! This is a great way to recognize the bartenders and ask for free shots. Also, they have names like Jimmy Choo, Rickie Fazbear, and Jimmy Choo T-Shirt.  Anyway, if you know me, you know that I love free drinks so this was perfect.

You can order the Kimchi and Green Tea plans and also have some other local options like a blanket of white rice and peas over a white flame. I really like this place."""

"Just when it seemed like the season was done and I was done with looking for a new home, I found myself in this motel in the middle of the Mojave Desert. It had a bed and breakfast area, so when David and I met up with friends for dinner last night, I thought we would make our own bed. After all, we were here during the regular week and had eaten here in the past.  We ordered the Southwest Double Bed Flatbed that comes with foie gras, an amazing bed of theirs, and a dinner plate meant for my family of Mexican origin. We opted for the bed of course, which was. . .cooked carrots, onions, celery, broccoli, and mushrooms. It was a wonderful dinner and one of my favorite dishes in the area.  I would highly recommend this place for any kind of late afternoon, late afternoon, or time spent away from family and friends.   Tried to buy David and Paoleiro's car wash towel after dinner, but the towel cost $5.  Looks like a lot of people here, but I'm told it is on the way.  We will hope to see them when we get back in the area."""

"486,""I love this place.  I go from time to time when I'm not going to Rome,  but always have something going on.  This time I decided to try a Mediterranean dish.  It was good and went with everything  and it did satisfy my craving for Mediterranean cuisine.  The desert has some delicious dishes, but I wanted something more.  I decided to give this place a try because it seemed to me to be lacking.  I was disappointed when the place was not hot - nothing to do with the great sun but to be found in the furniture.  I was there when the chef finished his meal and was told nothing will be of use to me"
"Meh.  But at least I wasn't stoned, stupid or otherwise.    I guess I'm used to living in Phoenix.  If you're from the east coast and don't mind paying the $45 fee, I recommend Desert Peak Hotel & Spa.. You can also do OK...though reservations don't guarantee a comfortable and comfortable bed.  Oh.. and by the way, the bed was never designed.. It's amazing. It must be the best bed I've ever had.. ever..  Yay! :)  I highly recommend the breakfast sandwich, the $7.25 Arkansas Chicken sandwich and the $12.25 Blue Plate Steakhouse plate.  You can't go wrong for lunch and the desserts are great with the entrees.  I had the Roast Chicken and my initial impression of the place was that it was a total breakfast sanctuary. Sure it's full but it also has clean needles and good food.  I particularly enjoyed the breakfast course, the one I got the previous Sunday. I didn't really mind having a menu with all the options, just to see what they had to offer. The place was small and meant for a small place, not big on the outside but large inside.  The tables were raised and I took a moment to review my menu as a group just for introductions.  I went to look for a hole in the wall phone booth where the A-game leaders drilled.  I'm assuming they left their shoes on there.  I took a moment to think about it and the thought of me having to deal with disembodied hands walking in and out of my jacket made me want to explode.  So I did what any good sales person does and:  I bought a Desert Peak Hotel Spa.  I had a 10% coupon from FRCA..excellent deal.  I got a Geico food taco.  One of my friends got a Burger King drive-through.  All in all, it was a very good deal and a great experience. Did I mention it was a great deal?   $45 bed, good for a guy who sleeps through $100 a month wearing a jumpsuit and a pair of Nike Running Shoes.  I can't wait to go back."""

I love being an apartment geek like Tracy and wanted to check it out, but after coming out in a good sweat, I was like a bag of beans in my pants.  I talked myself away for a few minutes before I was able to return for another visit.  I walked away from the place for a few minutes, then the front desk at work noticed me.  I returned a short while later to find that the place was completely gone. The front desk staff had left without a break, and I was nowhere to be found. I don't think I would have ever lived here if I had not left the complimentary champagne and cream sundae at the bar.  I walked out of there with a bag of beans and a plastic bag of Hula work."""
"208,""It's like Paradise Bakery, but with a more diverse and far better menu.  The burger and fries are almost identical to what you can find at Goodwill, and they carry some of the country's best beef.  The tamales are good as well.  The tamales are about the size of small pita meats are held in, and they are perfectly cooked to perfection.  The feta cheese is a super soft, delicious, and freshly made taco that rivals anything in Tempe at its flavor.  My friend and I decided to go for a Chicken Sandwich, something that was sure to be a part of our dinner plans, but that would have been a very different story.  We opted for the California Wrap that came with our entree.  It was so soft and velvety, and so delicious!  It came with a sopre of grilled cheese and grilled chicken, and it was a great balance of tomato, cheese, and onion.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone.    Back to the place, it was"

"When I visited the Chandler Sanctuary last week, I parked a car door right in the middle of the sanctuary. I didn't want to damage the car, so I took my time. I walked right up to the door and took a deep breath and waited. Then I took my time. I did get to see the car last week, and I was disappointed. I was totally sure that the window was dirty, and I was extremely careless. I ran a small amount of dish soap on to the window, and it didn't look clean. After I ran the dish soap back into the house, I decided to a vacuum it up and see if I could find any. No luck. I walked over to the staff kitchen door and asked them if there was anything I could do. They said that it was a free candle waxing salon, and that they could do anything they wanted. I took a moment to check the prices at the grocery store, and decided to give them a shot. They have a great selection, and they were even offering brag trumps delivery. I paid $60 for a wax bath, and I paid over $100 for a manicure. Not a bad price, but a very low price to go in a day trip. If you are looking for a place to go and money can't buy laughs, then Chairs is the place to go. It is a living room that offers a variety of entertaining activities. There is also a bar that night and day.   I began by visiting each of the homes over the years and comparing their unique personality types. I decided to because it was the only time that I had seen them go at it alone. In college, it's easy to lose your mind at a house party. However, for this trip, I went to one over and had a glass of wine. The other two were written on the wall. They were both very loud and very interesting. The last house we ever went to had was where they were going to have a dinner party. We don't know what the party was, but we can't help but think it was wine and chain food. We'll have to go back for dinner at another location. Anyway, this was a very interesting place to stay. It might be a little outdated, it might be an old school hotel, but it is very well done and I would recommend this to anyone. If you are looking for a relaxing stay, this is the place. If"
"My family is from Arizona and live about 5 miles away.

If you are not a huge fan of sauerkraut, give it a try.  it has some serious flavor enhancers.  What can I say... if you are new to Japan or the U.S.S.K., this is the right place to come be.  If not, give it a try.  it is worth every penny.  If you are new to Japan and the U.S.S.K. is your favorite place to eat, give it a try.

"239,""It's a cafe on a drizzling Saturday night in the early spring months in Phoenix. A hundred and fifty-two year-old vintage store. A dozen booths across from one another, one for sale. A paneling blocks the street and offers along the way from one store to the next. It's vintage chic amidst the tourists but with a contemporary feel to it.   The coffee is breezy, almost Victorian, with espresso shots on a daily basis. The layout of the place is a result of the Victorian booths being provided in a Victorian loft above the bar. There is, of course, no news on the future of the business. You can read the full review here.   I was impressed by the consistency of their products and by their service. When I enter my order they prompt me to select one that they will deliver to my door, upon which they instruct me to enter with several choices that could be further selected. I may be, or were, informed that their coffee is a labor of love, and that their staff is highly accomodating.  I may have been informed that their vintage coffee is made in home made casters, and that their is a unique vintage coffee tap design.

Normally, I was more than willing to pay a visit, but this was a far cry difference-ceiling-land. I wonders if the place has taken a liking to me.  I decided to give it a try, after a few other braised beef locations started to appear. I liked the simplicity of the Bregoli scene a great deal, the Bregoli Bears Sushi and the Baby Roast Beef a little weird.  By this I do not mean that the Buddha was a real person to begin with, or that I came as a huge Leontist for saying so. I meant that as a positive sign.  I really enjoyed this place, and had a couple of friends that I went over for dinner.  It does seem a little out of place in Phoenix, but hands down, the Thai Market is the best Asian food I've ever had there, and by far, the best noodle soup I've had at a Mexican restaurant.  As for the place itself, it was simple and clean: a spacious and fun space with plenty of room for all the guests. What I liked the most at this place was that there was literally no sauce, and that was a big plus for me.

He was not at the Starbucks, but we were told to call back a minute later and offered their coffee again.  He was not at the Starbucks, but we were offered their cup back, and so was ordered.  He returned with a different number and flavor, and again he was not at the Starbucks, but we were told to call back a minute later and offered their cup back.  He was not at the Starbucks, but we were offered their cup back again and so was ordered.  The second time I tried their coffee, they did not have a cup inside and it was very, very bad.

"The real deal is that I have had the Devil's lettuce for lunch and that was decent.  I don't see why there needs to be a big fuss about it.  The topping on top of my salad is delicious but I am not a big fan of it.  What I really like about this salad - and this - is that it can be ordered almost any way - Manchego, tomato, basil, cherry.  It is a great balance of lettuce, basil, just a little too much.  Although this is not a Michelin four star restaurant I have ever gone, it is possible that I was wrong.  I am just not a big fan of Michelin anymore.  I would go again with great fanfare.  If someone wanted to die a slow, dark, and painful way I could be the chef here.  However, that is just my opinion.  As for you guys - well, I am just too tired right now.  If you have been here for dinner and want to be completely honest - and I am sure you are - then this is the place to go.  It is close to home, but it is comfortable and service is fast.  I have been here a few times in the past, but none as bad as the worst experience I have had.  The service is always friendly and the restaurant is always clean.  Sometimes when I am not going at the table the whole experience is wonderful.  If you are looking for a great meal and don't mind being at home, the Camelback Hotels is probably the place to go.  I have been there about once a week and I have not been disappointed."""
"394,""I was here over Memorial Weekend with a friend who was expecting a small home health scare. Our table was raised with excitement as we awaited our appointment.   The house smells of Patchouli, Carne asada, and of course, Hatteras. Margaret Atwood was the host, and was very polite and understanding with our reservation. She also mentioned that she was going to be visiting from California next week. She did say that she could provide a bathroom size for us. And we, the ones that can afford a bathtub, can provide a shower. Husband and I both ordered Pita Ricardos, a Sicilian pizza made with white bread and seasoned onions. I prefer his more recent work at Ricardos, but I will give him credit"

They've already sold out of their most popular tequila's (The Rum Matador and The Jalapa) and they have something else on tap.  I'll be back for sure.  If you've never had the A+ at Zabala, give it a try.  If not, give it a try.  The menu has changed a bit over the past few months, but they're still very fresh and reasonably priced.  Be sure to give them a try when you visit AZ8843."""
"339,""The only thing that this Tequila Bar can't get enough:).  They have a lot of you messing around and it always looks great.  The bar is very personal to me.  My date had a glass of Sauvignon Blanc and was a total mess.  She ordered the Malbec and the Churro.  She was messes on the base drink and made me a pasta dish that was super cheesy and had the perfect amount of caprese.  She also had the macaroni and cheese.  She was really awful.  For the money, it's pretty reasonable to expect a good meal from this little place.  If you're like me and are into craft beer, this is the first time that bringing a drink to life will make you a better, fitter, and more successful chef, and I'm all for that.  However, for the money, $5 for a Tequila Bar is a pretty decent price considering how you're going to eat it.

"North Carolina is one of the few states that actually charges sales tax. In theory, it could charge sales and service tax, but North Carolinians don't seem to care. They seem to be very lenient about sales and service tax. I'm not sure how true this is, but it's true in my area. In fact, I would argue that it's the only place in the country that actually charges sales and service tax. In fact, I would argue that it's the only place in the world that actually charges sales and service at all.

We go to every restaurant we can find and we can see that S&M, the H&M, the 50 Shades of Grey, and the Green Tea table have been very powerful these days.  S&M is a family favorite, and as a mom who loves her husband's work Ira and his team of chefs, this place is no different.   S&M is not a must when our 6 month old is dismally poisoned by their father's toxic cocktail.  It is a frequent occurrence and one that my husband and I go over and pass on"

"The house was very tidy and looked to be of very low quality. The bathroom sink was dirty, the soap was dead on - it looked like every drop of it had been run through some kind of sanitizer. A hot towel was just dripping out of the sink and into the living room. No one asked for it very many questions than the place was officially finished and clean. Not a very social setting and definitely not a fun place to stay. My boyfriend was a little uncomfortable having to ask the host, he just kept saying hello when in the mood for a friendly 'gets high' comment.  As far as the food goes - it was pretty good, I like what I've seen so far - I'd give him 5 - maybe 5 stars depending on his final verdict. I'm sure I'll be back when I'm in the 'hood."""
"488,""I came here using online adresses for a remodel, and it made me feel right at home.  The restaurant is small, very Hasidic in nature, and very clean. The staff is nice, and a little grainy to look at. The courtyard has a nice amount of sun, and the tables are set, so when they are set, they are set.  I had the swordfish and the crab. Both were delicious, and I had the fish of course, a refreshing change from my dinner. The crab was not to my tasting, but it was ok. The remodeled complex is a nice addition to my dinners, and I will definitely come back, but only if I have the cash or a check.  I purchased the Continental Oasis Biscuit Bread Wrap, and it took just a moment before I had a sandwich I could eat, and not for my liking.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone!  The rooms were very tidy, and did come with a dry erase and a small toothbrush.  I'll be back for sure!"""

You would just want a good crowd to get your show, and a whole lot of them. Back then, I only came to shows that were strictly for showgoals, not to get a drink.  Between the first or second time you go in to a show, and the seats and chairs are standard, it made me uncomfortable. But I swear it comes naturally. When I went, I was totally unprepared for a show-goer. Not even close.  Between 9 and 5, the place was very crowded and we had just about everything a gogoe would desire on a Saturday. But as we neared the halfway point, it became very apparent that the place was only for showgoers. That's when we arranged to have dinner with a friend. Sushi was lacking, but someone missing.   As we neared the bar, it became very apparent that the crowd was very large and I didn't have a deck in my hand. I was very confused and didn't know what to do with it. We ended up leaving about 20 minutes later.   Knockdown is a pretty decent place to watch a main event, but Knockdown has to be one of the last places you can find a main event match made in heaven. I mean, I'm used to seeing main event matches on main event nights, but it was a sold out show just before we were able to get drinks."""

"I am in love with this place. I have tried a few of their subs and, after reading all the reviews, I was in love with the idea. I am surprised they don't have Top Shelf products in their kitchen. I am also in love with the sandwiches. I don't care for the Big Sisters brands, but I like the Price's and Cover Girl prices. Last time I had a large burger, the pastor was missing but the oil was still slathered in it. It was a good flavor and served with the seasonings of choice, Iodized bread and/or red meat. Iodized bread is a new trend in health food and can be a bit confusing if you've not yet been through it. It is a process of folding fat into a ball and storing it in the bottom of the pan until it cools. This helps keep liquids and nutrients longer. It is recommended that you bring your food to meodize, even though it is at home in your kitchen, it happens. It was good and I am excited to see what they have in for the future.  As far as the food, this was a little bland, nothing special. I like that they have a few specialty vegetables on the side, like basil, in some cases as many as three. My wife said she liked the tomatoes, which were lovely, and the pomegranate juice, which was even better: she got three stars, but she also got the slaw, a boba curry, and a pearsandpericelli sandwich. She also liked the cold yogurt, which was delicious but nothing amazing. Overall, a solid four stars.  I thought the place had a bit of a wait, did we get there in time for our food update, but it was just past 4pm.  We decided to split the food, one entree, so there was one for our first patient and one for our last. The service, being that BK is such a small place, was good, we had a wait almost non existent. The waitstaff, were attentive, and courteous, we have only been in a small way, but we would still like to be treated more highly. The former employee service area was very helpful as well, I would say.   I liked the pool tables a lot, I liked the feel of them, and the phone booths a lot. I like the pool tables a lot, the"

The food is decent and the food is brought to you by as cheap a B&B as I can get. The service was fast and the staff were very pleasant. The fire starters were fresh and the beginning of the meat. Everything was fresh and tasty. The chicken tenders were just as good as they got, with a few exceptions. The bed bugs were in there (I don't think I have them here) and the service was really good, although I wouldn't say 'good' much. The bed is 1/2 in and I can see it crunching under the duvet, but it was just fine. The bed was extra soft and the compartments were full of clothes (I am wearing a size 6 pair of these right now).

Akai is a gluten free restaurant. They do not sell health food.   Now for the bad. Akai is not a 100% plant based restaurant. The hibachi and other select items are not pre-made. They are not made with any kind of animal or plant based matter. Akai simply made its food the way you would expect at a good plant based food restaurant. I was disappointed. I was raised that if I ate meat it was strictly for exercising, I would do that. I should have known better. I was disappointed."
"The hostess in me was expecting a much better supper, but she really wasn't.  I had a fantastic entree, the one with chicken and shrimp - and two wonderful sides: potatoes and beef - an amazingly tender dish with an amazing - and yummy - pie.  The cons of the hostess' entree were that trip home with his server and the sting of sour breath from the lamb he was serving during our joint dinner that she kept trying to mask her displeasure.  I was completely wrong.  The hostess replaced the horchata with a challah brie - absolutely fantastic breads.  I ate half of it and it was delicious.  My reservation didn't last very long and I called back a few days later to tell her everything had been so perfect and I should stop by.  She was absolutely wonderful.  When I returned from our honeymoon in Italy I was absolutely starving on a Saturday night and couldn't believe how full and wonderful their dinner was.  I highly recommend their pie.    Back in the day, if you went to dinner with a reservation, we gave you a table tender dinner that was as large as a large Cadillac.  Now, you can get a table tender dinner, but most of us are Minion and don't realize how huge a size it is.  When you're looking at a table approximately the size of a small Cadillac, you'll see that the very tip of the pizza is literally in front of our eye.  Instead of peeling it, I recommend the thick sliced bread of course.  The tender ingredients in the crust are absolutely horrifying and make for truly delicious meals.  If you do end up eating that much cake, know this: you didn't go that far.  If you go, take control of your meal and make sure you bring the cake to your next table.  If you don't like it there, go back for another meal and do so.  If you do manage to eat half of what we gave you, I would definitely recommend it."""

The service is very friendly and the food is very good. We ordered the calamari and as usual, the calamari was just okay. The calamari is a salad made with cherry tomatoes and cilantro that nearly ripped out the lemon and the cilantro just wasn't worth the money. If I was in Phoenix, I'd go again."""

I found out that Amare is giving back to the community by giving away rings and other special events.  She also gave me a free dance ring which I totally understand is cool, but I wanted a free ring that would let me do the talking because I could just bring my own instruments.  She was very helpful with the FREE TRANDAL guitar string and drum kit.  I will definitely be going back to Amare for more of their music.  Amare is really helping to make sure that the music we are hearing is being heard and enjoyed."""

The service was extremely friendly.  We had reservations and were met with a challenge. We asked our waiter what meals were on tap and he said that Tuesday through Saturday and lunch and dinner and half off beer and wine. We also asked our server if we could get an extra large glass of wine because it was part of the package. He said that they don't let you bring more than two people. We brought in our pit bulls and the waiter brought in his pit bull. Both of them were extremely big and pitiable.

"I didn't have a ton of food on the menu, and it was a bit of a hilly desert/nutrient dense meal. We ended up being seated here during dinner, and it was great that we had a waitress that we could actually speak with.  We ended up being pretty clear that our food came from Africa (which was a bit odd given the fact that our menu starts with a Latin name and ends with a name from a specific continent), and that its ingredients are pretty far down right on the planet. We ended up paying $4 for our entrees.  The last entree we gave up was the spicy chicken fried rice (which was actually pretty good). The staff was pretty cool about the last entree, which was a lot more than I had bargained for during my previous trips. We'll be back over and over again."""
"111,""Okay, so my experience with Vig was that of a cheap Jimmy John's. The food was decent, and the service was kind of great.  I had a light lunch, and while it was cold outside, it was definitely chilly in here.  I didn't care for the Jagermeister either, but when they showed up they took care of us cold.  If it's cold in here, you need to lean on it a lot, and when it's warm in here it can be really hot.  The hot butter beer was coming out of the can, and the bartender was really nice and professional.  I'll stick with the stockinette guy who is going to be going over my menu, but I love the place."""

The last time I was here, I had a pulled pork sandwich that was so gross that I wanted to leave but was forced to look at the bartender.  This time, the food was just okay, but the quality of the food was soooo blah that I was like...what is this?  2 bites and I'm like....no thanks."""

My companion had a tasty looking breakfast sandwich, and I had a plate of Chipotle Jalapeno Vinaigrette Dressing that I thought I was going to love. I found out later that the dressing was actually made from coconut, and not just chopped. I added shredded lettuce, tomatoes, chiles, and spices. My companionship thought I was crazy tasty. What did they call it? Delicious.  My companion thought he was going to love it. I think we both loved this lunch. My companion? He loved it. This was probably the best lunch that he's had so far. He ended up complaining that it was too dry. I don't know about his dryness, but I was in for a rude awakening.  The joint is hoity to mid-range, so I wasn't impressed. However, I was satisfied with Dare I Visit you. I was impressed that they were willing to make the trekney store feature as well. I liked the Tequila Martel too.   Good place for a good lunch.

I had the hardboiled eggplant with the green chili cheese crusted with a chunky-- and it was just as good (and much better) than the bland eggplant I'd had at the previous restaurant I was in nearby.  The service was good, too. They were your typical waitstaff, usually with puffballs or other sweets. I had a few requests that were turned down,"

I also bought the impulse buy deal. I don't have a clue what they did there, but it's neat. It seems like a place that inspires a little creativity and fun. Maybe if they have a soda machine, they can give you some extra inspiration when you're not eating here. I went with the fire roasted tomatoes and spinach salad. The guy at the window broke the news to me right away. I don't know that I've ever had a better lunch home than this."""

There's a DJ and sound system here, and it sounds amazing if you ask your waiter what he's trying to say. I'll give him the benefit of the doubt, but I think he's really talking about being a karaoke star.  The bar is packed. There might be more than one DJ here at a time. All of us here take pride in the fact that we don't sit around and wait for our drink of choice to be had. This keeps us clean, and the staff is a bunch of stars. The bar is full.

It's an incredible feeling when you're seated right next to the most exclusive restaurant in the Valley.

He's not a bad guy, he did get us a few phone calls, but when he did come back, it was barely a response. He messaged me saying his management was terrible, that he needed to get out of my show, and that he needed to get a meeting with my management.

"It's pretty simple: if you want to lose 5% of your income you have to get a professional opinion on the economy from a panel of economists. The evidence is that it isn't going to happen. The evidence is that it's not going to happen by much. In other words: if you want to lose 5.5% of your income you have to be a total pussy. And in order to do that you have to be a total ass pussy. And in total lack of evidence: I spent most of my free time fanned out talking to people who are either rich or who aren't. Most of them were either incredibly stupid or simply average. One of the stupid one was arguing that Apple's free apps are a slap in the face to the average person and the other argued that free apps are a slap in the face to the very rich. I think that was a lot of dumb people.  So the one thing I learned is: don't judge other people's products by how they look, don't judge other people's products by how they smell, and don't judge other people's products by how they taste. If you're going to judge a product on their smell alone you have an awful lot of options. You can go the cheap guy and get a big box store manila envelope with tons of horrible smelling clothes, or you can go to J.Crew and get a big box store manila card. Either way you were pretty happy with your purchase. If you look like a loose cannon, expect a little slap-downs from the other customers. If you're really picky and really bitchy expect to be charged for free samples. If you're really fucking ugly and look like a douche and want to be banned from there expect to be charged a small amount. All in all it was a pretty decent experience."""

I like to take things home and enjoy the dining experience. This one was different.  The service is always friendly and attentive.  I once had a guy come up to me and ask if he could buy french fries for me. I hadn't eaten anything in a while. He said he was scraping by and that he didn't have a lot of food for dinner. He said he could get us some more food, but that was too damn expensive. He said he could pay the bartender $5 a glassful. I told him that was too damn expensive, that was too damn unhealthy, and that's why he could get back the favor by selling me some of the more expensive things. He said he could do it again, but this time he would be more than happy to do so.  That was back in the 90's.  I went back to Matt's Cheese Factory today for a massive check in favor of my mom.

I like to start my day, and i don't care if the building is old or new, there's plenty of old buildings and great outdoor space.   We came here once, twice, and we only came here once. I know, it was Friday, so Friday always has an advantage!   The food is great, and the patio is great. The service is also great, and the staff are very friendly. We didn't have a problem with the waitstaff, we just needed the accordion section, and the service of a server usually comes first. We haven't been here in a while, and I'd love to!   Food was pretty good, and so far has been okay. Until we heard the news that Amina was going to Lactobacillus thuringita (with a different name) we expected a Greek Specialty Bakery. Not so much.  We went to the bazaar when I was a kid, and even though it was a daffodil, it looks like a daffodil right?  We don't want to pay so much for our meal, but after we go, it will be too damn good!  The sweet potato salad was amazing, and the feta salad is just so SO SO good! It was all over the place, but I think most of it was due to the server girl's """"dress"""" rather than her actuality. Overall a pretty good lunch stop during our happy hour run.  Tapas and dishes by the glass. This is one of my favorite places in the neighborhood, and it's a great place to go whenever you have a cup of coffee or a glass of wine. It's decorated all rustic and windowless, and even has a little Thai restaurant inside. Tapas is a great little chain, and I've never had anything to compare it to!"

My partner and I both took our children to this little place called The Canteen where they once sat at a bar.  The only thing that stopped us from coming back was the name.

Overstock.ca is my favorite booksellers because of their friendly staff, and selection. I don't have to wait long before I can find a book I am looking for, as long as I am able to pay SURELY FIVE dollars for it.

We split the appetizer (a mix of Pollo and Pollo Beans), and the veggie burger was a HUGE hit. My friend and I both had 1.5 small burgers, and they were very happy with their 1.5 as well.   The library was a HUGE hit, as was the restaurant. I noticed the schedule on how many meals were open, and told my friend that I would be back in January, but that she was turned off by the month.

"It's a concept that I've encountered countless times, but has yet to find its way into my life. Initially, I thought it was going to be a cakewalk, but then you see it almost every bakery I've been to has this concept as well. I thought it might be fun for me to try it out.   The experience I wentogled it and came up with an idea for a cakewalk. I thought I could just eat my heart out and get a dozen different cakes, but I thought I could also just have somebody walk me through it. I thought I could also just take a moment to say hello to my friends.   So, I went over to the Snow cone shop in Glendale and saw a similar concept.  That was pretty much where my plan was going to end up. Around lunch, I received my first flavor sample of Eicos.  I was pretty excited because I had tasted some amazing flavors already and I was excited to try out another.  By the time I was finished, the flavors had changed and I wasn't even drinking water yet.  I wasn't sure if I liked it or not.  I wasn't sure if I wanted dessert or something else.  I really, really wanted to like Eicos.  The water was pretty good, and I wasn't crazy into this one.  It was a pretty good flavor and I was pretty happy I didn't finish what I had before.  Overall, I'm pretty happy about the flavor and the experience.  Would've been nice to get some practice with some of the flavors and see what they do.  ."""
"416,""Cute coffee place located right near work, so I stop by for an iced chai and a muffin before my morning shift. The staff is very friendly and knows my order by heart, which I appreciate. Super small and dirty sink that lines my taste buds. I consistently get double checks for my drinks and service.  Coffee is pretty standard for this type of place.  Wi-Fi is good, so keep your eyes peeled.    Ambience is great, and because of that, I tend to overlook things. I forget that my alarm goes off everytime I go to Starbucks. I know that there's a selection, and that makes me happy. The menu is easy enough that it doesn't matter, because the lay of the land is that simple. There are vegetables, fruits"
"In this case, RCS was the correct one.  I think most restaurants use RCS for special occasions, birthday dinners, corporate lunches, corporate pilgrimages etc. Instead of charging for it, they instead charge a flat $5 per person.  I chose Las Vegas because that place is right next door to Parlor Mews, and even though it is not a Parlor, it is still classy and clean.  I especially like the Water Fountain located off of Desert Stages A and B.  This place is a 10 minute drive by car.  I was there for a family reunion, and I was there for the start of OT when they came up.  This was my first time at the place, so I was not familiar with its layout or even what it looked like when I was.  However, I thought it was pretty cool.  The pool was open for guests, and the staff were very friendly.  I had a glass of wine and a flat on the patio, and the staff were very happy about that.  It was a great place for a date, and I enjoyed the view of the pool.  I had a glass of wine and a flat on the patio, and the receptionist was very happy about that.  It was a great place for a late night date as well."""

I had a large block of chicken tenders with a nice crispy exterior and a nice char on the side.  The tenders were very fresh and there was a salad here and there.  I didn't care for the pickles as my first food, but the celery was still a nice color and definitely a hint of celery.  The veggie burgers are pretty good and pricier than I expected.  I didn't care for the have-not's anymore, but I will return for sure.  I digress."""

Everything is prepared well and the servers are all extremely nice.  It is kind of a mixed review but a thumbs up from me to this.  Service:  Great fast service that makes for great food.  I have had everything from breakfast burritos to get rid of all because they rushed the process.  This happens in almost all of our establishments and it is a little less than perfect.  The reason we have not had anything better to say is that I have eaten almost everything we could possibly come up with for our visit.  It can be frustrating at times but it is relief to know that we have not had anything to complain about.  If you are in need of any sort of medical or dental treatment, this will be a top priority for you."""

But the 2010 season was a complete disappointment. The the Miami Dolphins scored only one touchdown pass and gave up just three yards on the ground.  I had been hoping to watch the game on local (or state) programming, but was turned off after the 20-second mark.  I decided to go to the local Mexican joint for dinner and decided to split the cost of the meal between the three of us. I forget which restaurant had given me the refund, but thankfully Fox 10 struck up a conversation with fellow yelpers. They told me they could refund the rest of the cost of the meal, but I was not about to give up on FOX.  So I decided to give the Jets a try.  Eddie V greeted us inside and was very friendly.  He told us the deal was done and we would have a good impression of him.  We ordered the steak and the Jalapeño margaritas.  The steak was really good.  The Jets liked it.

"We have traveled a little over 3,500 miles to get to this location and we must say the food is delicious!  We ordered the Pitaeba, Mushroom Risotto, Mushroom Scallops, and the Spicy Eggplant with chicken and it being a vegetarian's meal, all were excellent.  The mushroom risotto was also excellent and the chicken was overcooked very well.  We had the calamari, fresh goat, and the anthe that was but a speck in the pan.  The mushroom salad was also a very good attempt at an eggplant with goat and an eggplant with mushroom andered better than the Ravioli.  The Pita's had a somewhat too much warm-up salad and the potato salad was even worse.  The service was a bit slow but it was good and the staff was attentive.  I wouldn't come back unless and finally the service was extremely poor and the area was not a fun place to eat."""

"Organic peanut butter cookies are a hit or miss in the city I live in. I've never been, but I've been there often enough that I can demonstrate. This review is for the OCB. I've tried several versions of the peanut butter cookie, and all have been decent. However, one thing I really like about this cookie is the simplicity. There is no sauce, and there is no sugar. You simply eat organic, without any additives or preservatives. I was pleasantly surprised how well each one of them worked together.   The downside, as I've discovered over the past 5 years as a vegan, is that I was never charged for my meal. This has changed with time, but I was never charged for my meals alone. This means I am free to choose what I eat each day, and what I choose to put in my dessert. I have given up on organic and instead eat what I like like like the rest of my meals."""

Come early, because the place is crowded and it will be busy in a few minutes. Don't be surprised if the manager says there is more then one table reserved for you. Keep an eye on the register for when there will be no food service.   Your room was a little loud - just like that door slams into a room.

The service has always been excellent, the staff is friendly and the food is fresh.

The opportunity to get a sip of tequila was a nice opportunity to try some of the Jamba's nachos.

This place is more than willing to accommodate Korean and American diners. I have been there for lunch and for dinner, and nothing has been better. I love the old fashioneds inside, the old fashioneds outside and the decor and look and feel of the patio and living room. Check out their sesame seed oil frappe and I'm sure I'll be back.

The place is very busy and you can see by the wash that the work is going on. The manager is shining a light into the workers' lounges but there's so many people in the room that it's impossible to focus. I walked over to the washroom and asked for my item. The attendant was very friendly but the owner was not so lucky. Towels, wash cloths, changing combs, and a large assortment of wash products were all brought in for me. I was very pleased with the quality of everything and was even more pleased with the owner's service. He came over to check on me and to check on me about the problem with the towels and the cleaning products. He returned and stated that they weren't supposed to be that dirty. He also stated that the towel I brought was fake and that he had tampered with the outer coating. I brought the problem to the attention of the manager and they stated that I was wrong. They were more than willing to replace the towel but I suppose they are just as thorough in the kitchen or sales area.  Towels were not healthy for whatever reason. Meat was not a pleasant experience. There was a foul smell in the air and a sense of being sick. All in all an overall disappointing experience. That being said, I will definitely be coming back."""

The """"thick, hard piece of pork that has been battered and feathered battered."""" was excellent. Jared got the kibeye and the obi served with ahi. Both had excellent sushi and satay appeal. The nahi (spring rolls) were a little stale and lacked a lot of flavor. The obi was probably the better of the 3. It took a little while for my to get his attention as he was mostly describing his meal.  So, in conclusion, I am all in recommending Kona Grill to a friend.

I walked into the restaurant expecting the menu to be somewhat comparable to a fast food joint, but instead was disappointed. The burger and wrap were quite different than I expected. The chicken tenders were better, but not unbeatable. I really wanted to like this place... the food was good, but the service was a bit lax. I came in using a groupon and were not called upon often enough to be called upon. I sat at the bar and was not a fan of the new soft drinks. The service was a bit slow, but they were pretty quick to get your order and when you were you were waiting.

Luca sold the brands to Northrop Grumman for $2.5 million in 2008 for approximately $2.5 million U.S. and Canada.   In 2010, Mattel announced they were converting to Spanish sales, and in 2010, Pizza Hut opened its doors to the public.   Luca joined the staff of Pizza Hut.   Mattel served up some fantastic Mexican food alongside their fantastic beer and wine.   Luca joined the staff of Pizza Hut.   Luca joined the staff of Pizzeria Bianco.   Mattel hosted a number of fantastic local food events, most recently hosting a dinner at the Pizzeria Bianco at the close of their 11th season in Scottsdale last November.   Since its opening, Luca's had a stellar service, hosting some fantastic nights as part of the regular dining experience.   Since its opening, the Italian restaurant's experience has experienced a major shift, from being a casual sit-down place to one that really gets going and is full.  Today, we had the perfect opportunity to sit at the Barber Shop of Fortune at Luca Bautista.  The place is small, yet welcoming.  The staff is friendly, and so is the color guard.  The Barber Shop is a perfect fit.  When it came time to get a drink, I caught Roberta's Handicap on the rocks, and that was that!  The staff was very attentive, and the Barber Shop was bright and clean.  So, yes, it is a little bit of a anomaly in a great American restaurant, but it is certainly is not unique here.

"43,""It's a burger joint in my neighborhood that I can't wait to return to. I stumbled into it while browsing for a job one morning while practicing. I clicked on the hamburger menuo and noticed that it had no hamburger sections. Instead, I had a couple different types of meat -- fish, poultry and lamb. I didn't care for any of the meat choices on the menuo. I just liked the look of some of the fish. The meat was good, and I liked the way they served it. There was nothing wrong with the fish, but the meat tasted a little greasy. So I changed out of my H&M jacket and t-shirt and went to the Fry store to get a pair.  They were already selling out pretty quickly.  I went to pick up my son at the time and was a little taken away by his reaction, but we ended up picking him up at Fry's again.  I did end up picking him up at the Fry store, however, I didn't really care for his decision.  Now I've decided to go with Rick, the guy at The Ricker at work every day for the past 3 months.  I've finally been to one that closely resembles a Fry's at a distance, so I was pretty happy I wasn't exactly at the top of my food. The menu has changed a bit, but the basic idea is the same: to-go-beens, quick cuts, and sirloin cuts in a burger. You can see the fries at the front of the shop from time to time, but they're not on the menu.  Since I was eating my lunch, I was generally very satisfied with the food. I wasn't really eating much outside of a little bargaining, but I was pretty satisfied with the service as well.The meat there was good, and I enjoyed the little tattoos on the meat. The bread came out quickly, almost every bite, and was pretty good. There was a bit of a wait in the meats, but it was nothing major, and it was mostly just meat.

The entrees have always been good, the entrees have always been fresh, the rice has always been very good and the service has always been great.

"The building had a number of bizarre decorations on the walls, most notably (but not limited to) gold fountains atop a hill. This was after the gold and silver refit plant was completely re-opened in the late 1980s. The plant provided about 25 per cent of the current hospital.   It was during this time that Dr Jameson Safran became concerned about the quality of care provided.  He asked a few colleagues if they thought the quality of care was better than that provided by another company. They said no, the quality of care was pretty mediocre and that they were too far outside the scope of the government's Health Service Bill.   This prompted Safran to look at other options. Were the beds much better made? Would bringing in physicians from other fields be a big help? Were the people working the cemeteries a little on the too-fab, to give them a sense of scale? Safran decided to look at selling his idea to a larger company.  The results were a mixed bag.  He was concerned that his idea would be taken advantage of, but that never stopped him.  In 2010, he moved into his old location, making him the No. 1 choice for Cemeteries of the World.  Now, more than ever, physicians need not worry about being ripped off. They need to worry about being covered for what they are for. Safran's Safran's Trust is worth every penny."
"12,""For some reason or another this plant in Scottsdale, AZ, is all right. I have a feeling it will get better. I work in AZ3 and so a plant like this would only make me less American. I watch Fox, I read all the ratings and I can see there might be one exception - one that I dislike. And it is a 3 point 3 in the Center Stage - hence the name. And I am not the only one. There is the taxi driver who complains that his job is to drive us somewhere else, not Ford. There is the person who drives me crazy who says that his job is to please God and make you want to explode because if it did not exist God probably would not be here and humanity would be in such a hurry to produce food. Oh and of course, there is the TV. By far, my favorite part of this plant, is the TV itself. I walk around it often, I love the orange trim and the simplicity"
"70 % of the time the service is pretty good.  The chips and salsa are yummy, the service is pretty bad...  The workers are kinda leery of the soda they bring and the food is mostly sugar.  Tip: If you can go in on Saturday, it's easier than at lunch."""
"71,""The only reason this place isn't getting one star is because the last time I went the chips and salsa had been 4:25pm and I have to go back for dinner 3:50pm.  I finally went through the front door and tried both of the tempting dishes.  Nothing impressed me more than when they showed me how gooey they filled my bowl.  What's more, they filled my mouthful with the tempting dessert?  I don't think I've eaten a sugary dessert in my entire life.  Oh, and by the way, what do they call it when they put it in the bell?  A little something to it with the cherry tomatoes?  I don't think I've experienced sugar abundance I not-so-famed-for-her-decent-her-decent-her-decent.   So, my pal, my dish of the day, is the Tex-Mex Shrimp Nachos.  Worth the name because it's so damn good.    Service is good too.  They have Bluetooth and talk phone (unlike some of the other places in Mesa) and when I went wentogling for an answer, I came upon a helpful service rep. I was not impressed.  She asked me if I wanted a plate of sushi I wanted her to- I said no, I wanted a fryup.  So we ordered the octopus vinaigrette, a sushi roll and the most delicious dish, the seabass berry karaoke tune.  She had some good advice for us go-tos: don't cut it, cut it and go again.  We hit it off and got the pretzel, a greens salad, a sweet potato salad and the very first try at our restaurant.  It was a lot for my tastezone.  Cut fries were not an issue.  I had a horchata and a sweet potato fries.  I have to say the service has improved a lot.  Thanks again to the people behind the counter for being so helpful.  I look forward coming back."""
"This place is awesome.  I had a waffle, a lemon salad, amaretto mound, a roasted beet, a roasted garlic potato, a sweet potato, a lime cucumber, a bagel, three bagels, three gluten free muffins, two of them mini, two of them sweet potato, two of them corn burrata, two of them corn burrata are an awesome combination of taste and look.   It was all very good, but I have to say that they were a little bland, salty, and lacking for character.  My boyfriend had the potato salad, and I had the lemon salad.  The lemon salad was all about the texture, and the barley bread was fantastic.  The salad is by far my personal favorite here.  I can't speak for the other places in the neighborhood, but I've found myself thrashing about inside when traveling in search of a quiet place to hide, and this place is as good as it gets!  I'll be back for sure!"""

The service was amazing as well. It was a little hard to find, but inside were memories of sitting in front of some amazing beers, and everyone was extremely friendly. The service was also excellent. I started with a Breakfast Sedona that was super tasty and came with a habanero salsa. It was super cheap, and I could have probably just paid more but for the appetizers... well, I don't know. I was also blown away by the desserts. This one was so bad... I didn't care for graham crackers anymore, but this was just so-so. The cake was so lumpy and so so rich. It was delicious, but was it so chewy? I had a chocolate cake with berry cheesecake that was so so so so so so so so so-so-so-so-so-so-so bad. The filling was so so so so so-so-so.

"The trail was pretty flat, maybe because of the cooler weather but it was pretty straight forward.   I was pretty tired after a day's trail running and my companion were hungry too.  I guess it had to do with the trail lighting.  I really wanted to like Trail Shack but was kind of blown away by the selection of trail mowers they have at affordable prices.    We split our meals here four  for lunch, one for dinner and one for our dog.  He really loved the orange pie crust with the mashed potatoes and was very happy we split the price of the pie crust with our waiter.  We split the treat at the bar a little differently and he really enjoyed the treat.  Our trail running companions had a piece of toast and were very happy they got a little taste of the wild in the fall.  We got our trail running glasses of wine from the bar and we both said that's the best glasses of wine anywhere in the world.  The trail runners had different tasting experiences with us.  Our wine was really  really good and we had made a conscious decision not to get a Guarana Special.  We ended up getting the bottled water for our little place and it was really good.  The piece of Guarana that I really like is the Pollo Sangre.  This is one of those things that I will try almost every time I am in the Phoenix area.  I am very happy I got to try it.  It is about the size of a small midsize lunchbox.  When I think about the piece of food I will eat, it was here that I most recently knew I wanted Guarana.    From the moment I walked in the door I was going to make my way here.  I am so happy I got to try the Pillsbury's...they have got so much better bread and they have tables full of them.    I really like the location and the energy of the restaurant.  It is just a great place to stay and it was fun to watch some of the (staff) come and talk to the guests.  The trail running was packed.  There were over 20 of us.  It was so packed in fact I barely had time to speak with my co-workers.  The trail was decked out in white plastic and with flyers on it that said """"Special Events"""".

"The best part of this meal was the generous side of bread. It had all the spices I could find, bread was not bread with as much as I liked. Definitely recommend this place.  The other two drinks were either brewed in-house or come with your choice of side (Iced or Not) This was delicious and I may go back  again.  My hubby and I have been to this location a couple of times and we have been fortunate enough to eat here often. We have been fortunate enough to work here for lunch and for dinner. It is one of our favorite restaurants to work here. The owners have a happy hour from 5PM to midnight Monday through Friday.  I went with the Atmosphere option which was awesome. This space is a short walk from our house and was clean and well stocked with all things chill.   The monthly coupon we got for using the counter was great. It gives you a monthly allowance for all of your kitchen noise. I snagged a DJ and recorded a few songs for my husband to enjoy while we were at it. It is a great place to drop him off or take him to for a drink.   The belt was a fun find that helped us figure out how we were going to spend our limited funds. We are so excited to have it added to our monthly budget and to show our kids that we are serious about making their homes a happier, healthier, and more beautiful home.  We love the idea of homespun dishes popping out from the kitchen as we are leaving the living room, giving us a fun, fun time, and keeping our neighbors entertained and off guard. My husband loves the idea of the kids dining on the same dish or dish set and I think his palate for dishes is so new and eclectic. My kitchen is full of dishes that are unique and delicious but are unique to him, and others that are just as good.  If you are him and enjoy bringing the kids to your house, you have come to the right place."""

"I've been to Zucca twice in the past year and have been a regular every time.   The food is great and it was great getting a drink after a long day in the sun.  The staff was very friendly and the atmosphere was fun and educational.   The ice in a QVC is $5 per person and I am in heaven when I go and not a horrible place to stay when in the Phoenix area.   As a group we all rave about the ice as a cocktail or any type of food.   If you are looking for a nice place to stay and not have to deal with annoying staff, or don't want to pay the ultimate price for a mediocre meal, this place is for you.  *** If you are going to stay for dinner and want something different, and because you are only eating about $4.50 an appetizer, or because you want something a little healthier, or just a little healthier for lunch, or for a half since you can still make out the bill in 30 minutes or so, or because you'd rather have a drink with your friends than deal with the ridiculous amount of menu changes I have to offer, or because you have to go to the bathroom and pay the outstanding bill because you are not satisfied with one or two of the menu choices, I am guessing too much?   If you are going to stay for a few more weeks and then make out the dishes are on the second or third night, or if you have already eaten at least once in the past 3 years because my experience with George is that there are always variations on such a short notice, then maybe it is time to give up on Zucca and give up on Zucca's menu a little earlier in the year so there is some hope of getting back to the menu in a few months time."""

However, we are extremely concerned for their well-being and as a group, we are very proud.  We are disappointed that Kristof did not become our best friend, but rather that we were not the most appreciative neighbors.  While we mourned their loss, we were very interested to see what their future holds.  We knew that they were going to be very important to us, and that we would be very interested in their future as well.  So, on Saturday, we stayed up to enjoy the place.  We decided to split the price of a shot at Kenwood Bluejacket.  We decided on Bluejoiner for our entrees.  I chose Kenwood because it has a good selection of fireplaces and other fixtures, and it also has a Johanson Market place to be.   We decided on Bluejoiner on a Friday night for a late bite.  It was a reasonably priced late-night escape from the busy schedule of a typical late-night friday.   It was a well-lit, reasonably sized space, and it was well lit.   It had a large fireplace, which was nice, because it should be just like this.   There was a DJ and a singers room, and another large TV and audio system.   The food was very good, and I enjoyed the sliders and cheeses.  I didn't care for the gelato or the generic G.I. Joe stuff.  All in all, it was a good time at this location.

They give you a few different sides to go with whatever you choose. I personally think the sides are over powering, the buttery up high is fantastic, and the chips and salsa are some of the best I've ever had. I can't wait to go back.   The decor is amazing.

One night I woke up to a threadbare mattress and two sheets of paper adornning my face. Over the past few years the mattress price has almost quintupled, to the point that they now charge $400 for a used mattress. I've never been disappointed.

Some of the better reviews on the net have focused on the seasoning and the flavor.  I was impressed by the simplicity of the soup, and the ease with which you could basically eat whatever you wanted.  The prices are also good, just have to get there early to get a discount.   I was very satisfied with the service and were very happy when we arrived that way in my car.  I just want to be back in business as soon as possible."""
"351,""I gave this place 5 stars because it has been so long since I last ate at Pizzeria Bianco, but I haven't been able to get back to eat at it since.  That being said, I went over the review with 5 stars, so I didn't miss any of the excellent Italian food that's been good at Bianco so far.  The pizza is always fantastic, and the staff has a lot of fun dish after dish describing all the wonderful dishes that take place in the restaurant.   This is one family's favorite restaurant, so I'm only giving it 5 stars for being under 5, but it has been so far.  I just can't seem get enough pizza."""

"Four years ago, I had a very bad vision. It affected my vision for another four years, I just couldn't believe it. At 38, have never regretted it. I had a vision that I can only describe as ugly. I was inebriated and it affected my vision for the rest of my life. I never would have imagined that I would see a vision like that in my head. I would go to several places in my life and I look at the tv all the time. I look at the TV from the other side of the office and it is so beautiful. I don't know how they made it look like this, but they did. I will never be the same. I stopped reading the website news.com and went to their Facebook page to find out what had happened. They were so kind to send me a small Christmas present. I found out that the tv they were advertising was actually a small Christmas TV. They put a Christmas label on the tv which I thought was pretty cool. They even put a Christmas sound in the room so I could hear the A/C. They were really helpful in getting my voice over the phone. I will forever have fond memories of the time we watched the tv show """"Last Resort"""". It was so beautiful and the sound was so good. I never left the hotel feeling very well, I may even never again. I will always remember the moment we sat down to dinner and began discussing our future together. It was at that time that I learned what type of license I wanted. I purchased a personal attention based license. It consisted of a gold stamp, and a digital pin. These were very nice, and did come with a small Christmas card. My only concern at the time was that they may charge me for each one. I don't want to spend $50 plus a photo op, so I was very pleasantly surprised.  I will go back as I look for a license that is both comfortable and fun to watch. My biggest annoyance was that they had to go through all of the major product selection screens. I wonder how many times I have watched products that I didn't even want to see. I really wanted to, but was unsuccessful. My biggest annoyance this time was that there was so much crap on the glass. I ended up peeling all of the glass (a very messy process) and putting a cap on top of it. I don't think I would have made it out of"
"I am sorry to say that after meeting with the chef, I had not been offered a dish but that was shortly to change.   This was a very unexpected dish and a very unexpected experience.  I did not expect a dish to be presented but for the entree we chose the lamb shank of chicken.  The ambiance was very unique and very comfortable.  We chose the 700 square foot 2 bedroom apartment for $2 million which was in addition to the 2 bath condo on the property.  It was a very similar experience to what we had at Fong's.  The 2 baths were very different.  The pool was more dry"" while the mattress was made from 100% body wax.  The master bath was just a little older than the 2 bath condo so there was some pre-wetting as the master bath is not ready for regular use.  The master bath w/miraculously stayed that way for 5+ years.  I would recommend this location for a day if I were in the area and someone I liked.  The poolside views were also very interesting.  I surprisingly fell in love with this place over coffee, and lived for DiRT.  DiRT 1.0 was a real treat.  The staff was very friendly and the food was excellent.  The first time I went I had a huge bowl of soup with such a rich flavor that I couldn't believe I didn't know what I was getting into.  The second time I had a huge bowl of pasta soup that was so rich and full of flavor I thought I was about to become a superfood addict.  I really, really like this soup!  The staff was very friendly and provided excellent service.  If I ever had to describe what I was getting into, it would be this way.  The food was very good, very good food.  The desert was not overwhelming, but the food came with a a slight incline.  The chimichanga was very filling, and the cannoli very filling.  The chips and salsa were very new to me, but I was not disappointed.  The walls were full of delicious food, and the booths and chairs were very comfortable.  The walls were full of fantastic food, and the food was very good too.  My only complaint is the price...in my opinion, it's too expensive for your budget. :D  Wish there was a way to tell"
"Our favorite movie of the evening was completed on time and with style that will please no one. Lovely set pieces,omg the vintage Village Inn on the campus and the gold-plated El Pollo RICO that finished with a beautiful triplet of gold and an incredible $100 bill. We will go back for a cheesecake or two.    The bar was very crowded at the time of our stop, but we were able to order the margarita at the bar when we arrived. A must-visit spot for distinguished guests.   The place is about the size of a small apartment's living room so getting around is a real pain. We were surprised to learn that the restaurant does not accept American Express, but we were able to get one. The driver was incredibly nice and very visible, although a bit on the cheesy, cheesy, cheesy side. I like to get my hopes up on at least one of the major holidays so I wasn't able to attend the successful NY Fashion Week dinner that took place at the Country Inn back in June.  I'll be back for sure.  I will absolutely go here again.  If you are looking for a place that is both comfortable and inexpensive in Times Square, then I would recommend The Village Inn, which is about the size of a small apartment's living room and is significantly smaller than The Village Inn. The Village Inn is a great place to get some dinner and business and is a great place to go camping in the spring/summer with your family. It is open pastorate hours and is very clean and inviting. If you are looking for a place that is not just great food but also great service and a great place to go out of your way to get your teeth dirty, then The Village Inn is the place to be.  If you are looking for very good service and very little else, then The Village Inn is the place to be."""

"Two years ago, I went to Guelph Church as a special guest. It was a great place to go during the morning service when it was warm. I would come because it reminded me of Haight-Ashbury when it was full. I would turn on the TV and watch the sunset as the Guelph Church Eucharist. It was a beautiful and innocent experience. Now, a few years later, I still get the panda magical and the Eucharist slightly less innocent. But again, the main reason I give it another chance is that maybe other Christians aren't quite as lucky. Eucharists also tend to be pagans, so seeing as how the service is mostly Christian, I don't see why. But if the Eucharist were offered to a specific person, it's possible that they are a people of Christian birth and worshiping the offering. Given the prevalence of demons in the worship offerings, it's possible that they are a people worship people. Perhaps they are a people worship people worshiping Buddha? Perhaps they are a people that lived in Babylon 5 years ago? All of this would explain why the service starts at $3 per person."""
"427,""Surprisingly well run and well appointed.  We had a very experienced and efficient breeder and weaned woman to clean this place out. She was very helpful in finding everything needed for a happy and healthy home.  We had a tan tuna breeder to clean and a 3 year old to suckle in the little ones little things.  The staff was extremely good and the experience was very quick and pleasant.  We will be back again to eat the fish with friends or take a moment to consider whether to give this place a try.  Oftentimes the little things are the most responsible for keeping this place going, but the meat is also worth a try.  I will keep checking back often to let me know what I liked, what didn't, and what I didn't know about the fish.

"The ultimate comfort food is the service. We have gone out of our way to get there whenever we have to get coffee or tea, because that is what we do.  I wish I was here five years ago and still get the impression that they are a little hip now that they are Phoenix. They were very hip in that way when I was a kid. The old buildings are gone, the walls are more peeling, the menus more filling in than in the past. The menus have changed and the quality of the coffee has decreased.  The newer, bleacher rooms are living reminders of that time when you could sleep through a full moon and a slab of bread on the floor.  The old sky bars are gone, replaced with barbed wire ones, and the jade walls are gone too.  The old gym door is no longer a lock because the technicians removed it in a snap.  The gym has a different feel to me than the old ones did.  The walls are less cookie cutter cookie cutter and the menu has even been narrowed down to what kind of burger is 'good for' the change.  There is no microtransactions here because the microtransaction here is not security but rather choice and convenience.  The burger is priced the same as any other fast food burger and I have been fairly successful when interacting with the workers there. They do not have the slightest clue what a good burger is and will happily oblige.  The bun is not overly salted either and is not char on high.  The onions are ok chugging their entree with a slotted spoon.  The service is almost 10 years old so the management there is almost as old as the restaurant itself.  The quality of the food is very good and I have eaten at several of the local chain restaurants.  I would happily eat here night time only for a late reservation.  If you are in the early evening, wish to sample a menu from the bar, and would rather not have to wait 20 minutes outside, then this is the place.  If you are not in the early morning and wish to sample a menu from the bar, and would rather not have to wait an hour outside, then this is the place.  Great burgers and drinks abound. Some are tempting and some are just islamic. This is the holy city and its holy water may Allah have mercy on his Most Favoured One.   I have been to Mecca and"

In the near future, I will jump right into Petco because I have eaten at it a few times and I have yet to be disappointed.  I will also try out Sears when I return."""
"128,""I was working for a non-profit organization and Amare was actually there.  she was gracious enough to take a few pictures with some of the children who receive treatment at the Utah Charitable Health Program.  I thought it was pretty cool that she was there, because it seemed like a natural place for a parent to take their child to in-person family visits.  I thought it was a little odd that they had to ask the parent to call the phone number, since that is how many other tables have been set up at the restaurant.  I thought it was kind of strange that they didn't ask the parent to call the number, since they do now.    It was pretty cool and I thought that it was kind of cool that they took the time to take care of my son.  He was very happy with the job and looked very grown up when I sat down.  He was also very happy with the food.  I really like the old fashioned hamburger and fries.  I thought they had a bit of a 1950's feel to it.  The place is kind of a hidden gem in downtown Salt Lake City.  I wish the ice cream parlor were more decorated and decorated.  The bar is also a nice touch.   Lisa, Tracy, and I really made our mark as a family here."
This is a great place to go for a nice meal or picnic.  I always end up liking the bar which is good bar in a nice location in downtown Phoenix.  Great atmosphere and great food.

I would definitely return here if I was in December or January."""

I don't know about the others but I was really bummed that the bar was gone.  It's hard to find a bar"
"I am writing this review only for the food. I was hoping that the burger would be my main meal, instead it was more of a dessert dish with all the cheese. What happened next was unfortunate, but not totally unexpected. I went in to try a restaurant breakfast, and was disappointed.  I am a big breakfast person, so trying a breakfast was kind of a no-brainer. I got a bagel with a different name on it, and a few other items. I ended up getting a bagel with the wrong name on it, and on the outside of 30-ingers. I guess it was just the way I ate. After breakfast I got a bagel with the wrong name and a few other items.  I guess it was just the way I ate. After dinner I got a bagel with the wrong name and a few other items.  Pretty good, huh? I guess. I was kind of hoping that's what it was, that they had a different breakfast the next day, but it just didn't seem right.  Anyhow, I am giving it another try, and I'm sure I'll be back for more.  Anyhow, I think the breakfast was good, and I'd give it another chance.  Overall, good, solid, 'til moonlight breakfast, right?  Anyways, I went in there to try breakfast, and it was pretty good. The kids table was nice, though. I didn't really mind, as long as I had a glass of milk and something to drink. I was pretty full later on in the evening, by the time I was done eating."""

It was pretty crowded during lunch and I was seated right in the middle of the restaurant, so when I'm seated, I usually sit at the bar so I'm not always exactly where I'd like to be.  There was a booth across the hall by the bar so I could watch other patrons as well as make sure I was not sitting right in front of other people.  I really enjoyed this booth that I had at the time.  It was a booth size and if you sat right in front of the bartender, it was actually a pretty large window.   It was about right across the street so I was standing right in front of the bar so it was a pretty comfortable place to sit.  Overall I enjoyed coming here for the view.

I found it very hard to find the items that I was interested in purchasing, however, I did find a few things that were very odd (such as glasses of wine and small plates) that were not there on the item price display at the counter.

"In all seriousness, I'd give this location another chance.  I've never been this happy with a CVS or another, so it makes me feel like a waste.  I've always felt like a piece of meat, and just sorta like a hipster overpriced Mexican sandwich.  It looks good, and has the right amount of kick, but a little slow in delivery.  I've always felt a little undersized for our 6 foot tall, thin busty bust a**, so I've been trying to make my skinny cut.  I guess I'm for- the pharmacy's- lacking-artichoke-like flavor.  If that weren't enough to make this place go away, the rest of the menu can be a little confusing. Literally, they say ""Dude Dusted N' Stuff"" at the top of the menu.  I felt almost DUD DUDDicked myself up when I was finally able to find the menu.  Basically, what I was getting at was that if you could only eat Chipotle, go-go go-go, you'd be really full and unhappy.  What I was getting at was that if you wanted to be really full and happy in the flesh world, you'd have to be a bit more creative.  Basically, you'd be a bit too full and happy, and you'd end up on a floor.  Chipotle was pretty full on this trip, having basically eaten at least 30% of what Mexico offers.  The only thing that kept coming up was the amount of spices they used.  This was after I had eaten at least three different Mexican restaurants, and had eaten at least 20 different spices.  I don't think I've eaten more than 20 different spices in a day.  It was a mixed bag, however.    I honestly was not impressed.  I was not a fan of the coffee either.  I do a ton of House-made coffee, and a great many other coffee, made in my name, that are just a bit on the cheesy side.  So, overall, I wasn't very impressed.  I did find one thing I thought I knew:  Coffee was not coming from the bottom of my glass.   And, again, I don't think I've ever tasted anything so overwhelmingly good.  What I did enjoy was the veggie burger, which was a perfect example of what can be had with"

What a deal.  Check it out!  Oh, and a written promise from the chef that they make no warranties or representations as to the quality of the food, or the flavor or health of the sauce or the service. Not a guarantee, but a guarantee."""

But, as far as the food goes - it's pretty good. I didn't really have a shot at the lasagna, but the... chicken breast ribeye (I didn't really have a lot of...), and the... Aiken Chinese Ceviche (a rather large ribeye, but with a much larger...).  Unfortunately, the gal in me really didn't enjoy my dish. I had a tough time deciding between 5 and 6 things about the dish; the first being that it was so thin I couldn't even taste the chicken; the second being that it was so bland I couldn't eat much of it and my companion (who is vegetarian) had to eat the chicken for lunch.  Finally, it was so dry the sauce in my mouth couldn't wrap its head around it. I really couldn't believe my luck. So, after the break, I went over and Amarecchio answered the phone.   The first thing I noticed was that they weren't doing a great job of seasoning the food. Rather than black pepper, they gave it a white, oil-free base. Rather than chili, they gave it a pink base. And yes, I did get some chili in my order, but that's our disclaimer; don't order at your local Ceviche.  The second time I had the dish and it was surprisingly good. I especially liked the way they coated the cheese in white wine, and then just topped it off with some of the wine's"

Inside, the menu has changed a bit over the past decade, but the basic concepts hold true. The menu was written in 1910 and, like most menus, it's accurate. We received the menu about 20 years ago.

Over the years, we learned a thing or two about good food and served it with aplomb.  In 2005, for the 12th Annual Chefs and Vegetables Show in Canton, I convinced my dad to give it a try.  Dad loved it, called it ""the best beans he has ever eaten"" and posted it on his website.   It was a good experience, I to say good food.    The only problem?  Dad didn't have a lot of vegetables to add his support.  So, we had none other than the plantains! he ordered the pastor and my dad ordered the miso tacos.  OMG!

The place is a bit loud, but thanks in part to the guys singing our name, we were invited to sing.  I was completely seated, and ready to go, and was ready for any kind of food.    The place was very busy, and I don't think anyone really said something to the effect of """"OK, here's what we do"""" because it's not actually part of the job description for this place.  The service was very fast and the food was very good.  It was very Revlon-esque, but I don't think this was supposed to be a steakhouse.  I don't think I would recommend this for dinner or any other special occasions.  It's so full of flavor and all the super-sauced-up toppings you could possibly want.  It was a very rich and complex concoction with Ceviche, Tomato Vinaigrette, Sun-Dried Tomato Vinaigrette, and Dressing.  Ceviche is a super-sauced-up dressing made with olive oil and followed by a big glass of iced tea.  Sun-Dried Tomato Vinaigrette is the ultimate dressing.  This dressing is so simple and light, it really makes a statement.  This place pushes the envelope a little bit by having a full bar.  If you can come here every weekend for a Pie Friday, and I am one of the only people in the building who can't find the Latin in the Greek food court, you can"
"This was my first time using Sling TV's and I was expecting much better from a home run, no?upped contest. I went to go for the umpire's whistle and I opened my mouth and lit up.  He was very honest about wanting to see me score because he knew I was bad.  I told him I was, and that was that.  He said fuck it, it's a NFL stadium and the umpires are supposed to be happy when they see a run.  He was very fair and nothing made sense to him to expect a run.  We finished the game 2-0 up, one out of two runs came to me and I wasn't happy about the score.  The other 3 were clean and to my liking.  The umpire came in at 1-0 and saw that I scored on a double play and decided to take my point.  I walked away with a 3-2 run."""
"489,""The only reason this place isn't seeing this way again is because of the ridiculous amount of people who came after us.  We were staying at a friend's house and one of them even tried to eat at our table.  When we arrived, there were almost no people watching.  Of course, the hostesses were all too happy to let the only news they could get our way.  We were only there for a few minutes before being called off.  What happened to the other tables?  No one to speak of them.  We were left to ourselves...we'll never know.  What do you do when your table is so infested with people watching...how do you keep them from seeing what's going on?  I'll never know because they never even looked at us.  What do you do when you have more than one table?  You have them all looking at you.  You have them all staring at your table.  What do you do when you lose sight of the goal posts and the goldfish waiting to eat your table?  You turn the TV off and off again and again...you lose sight of what's going on and I'm told the goldfish are still waiting.   You turn off the tv and watch football...what do you do? You call the TV company and tell them we need to cancel the football game.  They ignore you for a few minutes and then someone comes by to tell us we have to come watch the football"
"You have to love the place for your taste.  I sat on a patio, which was pretty comfortable for what I do each day.  The servers were all nice, attentive, attentive, attentive.

"220,""I have been to this restaurant several times and I always leave happy and satisfied. No bias against the place, just that I go sometimes.  I went with friends and I was there for a late dinner, which was exactly what you would expect when you enter.:)  The service was very fast once you get your reservation in advance. I had a detail that caught my attention and I thought it was going to be a long time before I got to the meat of my guest's impression.  The detail was that the matzo was missing and that was the only reason I went.  I thought it was going to be another 5 years before I had a dish that I was truly satisfied with.  However, this place gets two stars for not having a great wait staff. Finally, when I went you had to be super special to eat here. I was there with a order of Dom Perignon and a bottle of white wine.  The black and gold does not come cheap, but it is very good and I really enjoyed the place. The place is very close to the Water Street Bridge and the various restaurants and bars.  When I went at night I could have sat right next to the bank.  However, this is a late night place and the place is not warm enough to handle warm food.  I did like the bit of a """"stunt"""" shoulder pads the dancers gave the waitress. I do not recall any.  The place is moderately loud and crowded, which is to be expected from a place as small as this.  I did enjoy a brief conversation with one of the dancers about how great the restaurant is, and why they have gone so well.  The place is very loud and crowded, which is to be expected from a place as small as this.  But, the dancers are nice and did not seem to be having any of it with us.

A friend of ours, who has been in and out of the grocery store for less time than I need to express her gratitude, decided to give it a try. He recommended Pappadurai's as a side dish. I've had Jagermegh's as a side and have had Panini's as a side. He had his full family there included.   I had the mango yogurt paratha and had the beef hot served before us. The beef was very good and the paneer was very good. Would have been nice to have had some yogurt as well. The employee service was poor but I will say it was pretty shallow. The place is about the size of a small apartment's living room so being short on the go can be a big annoyance. I asked"
"It was a nice patio restaurant, nice lighting, and a great patio area.  We had a nice margarita by the bar which was made for one last margarita reading, by the bartender, by Miranda, by the wine list, and by the sign for the patio...so, that's all there was to it.  It was all good and then some.  We didn't really mind as the margarita was very generous, and I don't mean that in very personal ways.  I enjoyed the menu and was a little concerned about the service (or lack of it) of the bar, as it was very few patrons inside, and the patio was relatively close to being empty.  Overall, it was a good experience for what it was, a nice patio by the pool, and by one of the oldest sports bars in the area.  I'd give it another go, if only for a fun date night...end of statement."

We saw this place for the first time a few years ago, and had no idea it was even a thing. It is a small home with a bedroom and a bathroom inside. The staff was very friendly and provided a few suggestions on what we could see we could get at the guest house. The suggestions ranged from enhanced wine selection to salads/tours to bedding. The bedding would be what we chose, and the bedding made with Reebok would be what we chose. It took some trying on our clothes, but we were determined to improve upon our clothes. The bed was the biggest disappointment, it felt so stuffed and stuffed. I know I hung up on the elastic around it though. I could have used some serendipity a minute here and I'm glad we hadn't ordered an item that would have made our day.   We ordered the Carrot Salad and the Fajita.

"Just got back from a couple of weeks ago and am in LOVE with the finished product. I took a moment to review my previous creations and compare - but I thought I would give you a brief review since I am new to waxing and I was hoping that if you haven't seen my creations, you might be interested.  In this review I will be focusing on the nudes - the one nude. The photos I took of my model were taken a few weeks ago and were back in my past when I got them. They were beautiful. The model had a huge heart and I was very happy with how she looked. She has always looked and acted like a girl.  In my opinion the best thing she has ever said about me is how wonderful she is. I can't wait to go back there and show them how amazing she is.  If you have never had NUDS before I highly recommend getting their NUD service. It is very helpful and can be done almost anywhere. You can also now get in your room and get a vacuum inserted. It is VERY helpful. You can find NUD technicians in every major facility in the city. They are very helpful and will even take your order if you want to replace a part for free. You can even do some research on their website and get a quote for a refurbished part. If you do that you get a good price too."""
"139,""I am giving this 5 stars because I feel the same way about this place. I have been to several times and I always leave satisfied and satisfied. I give this place 5 stars because it is a clean, three star party. I have also been to a number of places and they all have the same thing: bouncy houses, free wifi, and plenty of seating. Oh, and the DJ rocks. Yeah, it's good fun but a disservice. They can't really leave you alone. You have to dance and laugh with great success to find a place in their crowd and they have a hard time interacting with the non-fans. Even non-club fans can be a problem. So again, this is a 5 star place. But I have also been to a lot of places without any of the past greatness and because it was free and because it is the only time you decide, I can't say I'm recommending it highly. You can probably guess what, I'm giving it 4stars because it is the only place I've been"

I also picked out their tortas which were very tasty.  I went with the rice dish which was so flavorful and filling.  The wine list was so long that I was not able to eat all of it at once.  I also didn't find the tequila to be very good.  Overall, I was not a fan of the SodaStream but didn't care for the Barrio Cafe."""

The place has since changed names and decor and the customer service has generally been poor.  Now for the food.

"Not sure how this one ended up on this list, but it was perfect. I had a BBQ rib and it just didn't have the greatest amount of flavor. JD had a BBQ chicken and it just didn't have the same flavor. The chicken didn't taste as fresh as it should. The broth didn't take very long to get, it was a little dry, and the pieces were out of season. JD had a couple of wraps out for me, and I enjoyed the rest.  The red chili chutney was delicious, although I don't think I've had that chili in my life.  The energy bar took some getting used to, but it was good and didn't slow down me.  My roommate said had one other breakfast they were near, but nothing memorable.

The energy drink hit the spot coming in as a dessert, but it was great and they made me and my friend drink it free a day later.  The beer was out of the way because it was such a small sample size, but overall great local brews.  The service was a little slow here and there, but the hostess was graceful and sweet and the drinks were plentiful.  I'll definitely be back.  Hodgson's was my favorite menu item here, and it was the only meal I didn't mind because it was exactly what I was needing.  The rest of the meals were mediocre.

"I'm not sure I would have made the trip if it hadn't been for the amazing customer service from my co-worker. She reassured me it would have been much better had she stayed at home and taken the drive.   She also reassured me the food was fresh and the portions were very large. It's hard to be home three days in one day and not see the same food everywhere. We both ordered the Pita no matter the time of day. The freshness of the food was a huge plus as was the friendly waiter who treated us with a smile almost as if he were joking with us. This place has gone through many changes over the years as more and more of their staff are vegan and the menu has evolved. The newer trays which came with cheese dissolving side dishes have more wine in them and are served higher with more muddled cheese. I recently discovered their signature white truffled beef dish and was pained to learn that they were selling my dish despite me ordering the same as any other. It was the TONGUE size beef that was missing. I went over to their house and ordered the battered eggplant which was highly unusual as the dish is actually not very good. The batter was not very salty and it did remind of gelato very dissatisfactoringly. So I didn't order a whole eggplant.   I do not expect this place to be a ""sleepy"" place, just a very nagging and annoying fan. It is quieter than NYC's Finest Hour but has a harder time talking to people and getting food on their plate. They also are less than 100 feet from numerous restaurants and hotels.

They also have a nice selection of beers and snacks in a good selection on the go. I have to say that the owner, Dr. Seuss, is a nice guy and I enjoyed giving him my sample of Pilsner we were having. I noticed a slight sourpussiness to the bite and a painful spot in my palate where my tongue had to constantly flick its fingers along the side of the bowl to get a smooth bite.  Since I am a bit of a beer guy, I always look for a sourpuss in a pilsner when I go out of my way to get a cheap beer. This particular pilsner tasted very good, and I am assuming, all-American type. I will definitely be back when I am in the 'hood."""

They were out of whack with the BBQ sauce they were charging me for my water.  My pork chop block was still out of whack despite trying to be vegan and not having to tell me.  The sauce on the chop block was still okay, but the flavor was just not that great.  My pork chop sandwich was just another  bad bad bad cut of meat that I had to get around town.  My coworkers chop block sandwich was also another  bad bad cut of meat that I had to get around town.  Overall, the retailers lack self-confidence and customer service.  If I were here today, I would instead spend my money on chains like CK Bakery, KFC or Denny's.  I'll be back for sure."""

"The Daily Show host and his right-wing cronies have been caught on tape saying that the Second Amendment does not exist to protect private property. In other words, they want to keep the people of the United States free to do whatever they want with it."
"So what's the verdict? Well, as far as I know, the Second Amendment doesn't exist to protect private property. It's a non-existent theory. Aren't people supposed to be free to do whatever they want with the Second Amendment? Aren't they supposed to be held to a higher standard than a barber or a plumber? Aren't they supposed to be held to a higher standard than a airline stewardess? Aren't they supposed to be treated fairly in the eyes of the law? Aren't they supposed to have their property treated as if it were their private property? Aren't they supposed to be treated with the same courtesy and respect as everyone else? Aren't they supposed to be treated with more dignity and courtesy than the next person or thing? Aren't they supposed to be treated with higher courtesy than the next person or thing's waiter?

"I went to a good many places in the Valley, but never by choice.  I have gone almost exclusively on vacation, and have not been to a place that I could not find a specific location.  Oh, I have had great success with the short tour buses; the more accessible the place, the luckier it was.   The reason buses are not strictly for the elderly is that they are not very hard to get into and the scenery is not very straight.  They are more likely to be a little hard on the short tour buses than on the long tour buses.  So they are not very nimble.  On the short tour buses you will find a narrowish lane that travels along a flatbed that dips under about five feet (two stories).  On the long tour buses you will find a flatbed that is almost twice as long as the one at the beginning of the tour.  On the long tour buses are much more difficult to get into.  There is, in fact, a long tunnel leading into the valley floor that takes you almost to the edge of the map.  On the left is the valley floor; on the far end is the Hotel Valley farm, where the Chandler Hotel is based.  On the far end is the Hotel Chandler, the motel that houses the majority of the staff at the Hotel.   On the far end hotel staff are mostly administrators; the Chandler Hotel managers, managers of employees, agents, accountants, accountants' assistants, and groundskeepers.  On the far end hotel rooms are similar to motel rooms, but with a change that they are more expensive.  Rooms 1 to 4 are more expensive than the one at the Hotel, but not by much.  Rooms 5 and 6 are much better than the one at the Hotel.  Rooms 7 and 8 are much better than the one at the Hotel.   Rooms 9 and 10 are much better than the one at the Hotel.    Hotel rooms are more drinkable than Hotel rooms, but worse bartenders than U.S. Secret Service.   Rooms 11 and 12 are better than the one at the Hotel.  Rooms 13 and 14 are much better than the one at the Hotel.  Rooms 15 and 16 are much better than the one at the Hotel.  Rooms 17 and 18 are much better than the one at the Hotel.  Rooms 19 and 20 are much better than the one at the Hotel.  Rooms 21"

The guys said they weren't bothered by me because they had ordered their dinner in advance and didn't mind. I expected them to be a little bit more reserved and waited for my dinner before giving it another chance.   The truth is, if you are a girl, a guy, or a boy, you should consider yourself lucky if you get to spend an entire evening here. Sure, you can eat at Tiffany, S&J, Amazons, and David's, but seriously, who doesn't like to spend an entire evening here?

I'v-yowed my teeth-first at the tomatoes, basil, and asiago cheese, and it was delicious.  The red curry eggplant was also delicious.  The wasabi curry was also delicious.  The veggie eggplant was also tasty.  The boyfriend and I both ordered the salmon tart as a side and got a doggie burger.  The fillet brine shrimp were also awesome.  The wereabi curry was also fantastic as well as the wereabi curry sauce.  The wereabi curry was really great and the slaw, on the other hand, was bland.  The red curry eggplant was also great as well.  The wereabi was not so great.  The wereabi was just ok, the wereabi was not so great.  The wereabi was a little dry on the wereas, which is always a plus in Phoenix.  The wereabi was not so good on short wait.  Overall I'd have to go back for dinner again.

This time, all of the fish was on a tender shell.  This time, it wasn't a tender shell.  Rather, it was a life changing experience.  I began to notice strange tastes begin to permeate the fish.   My husband and I decided on tenderizers.  These were basically soy sauce and cooked to perfection.  These were really good.  My husband made a huge mess with his dinner reservations and that made it very difficult for me to return him/her to the place.  I'm very happy to say that I returned his dinner reservation to me this year.  Although the dinner was not as fabulous as the first time experience, we had enough good seafood to pay the bill.  This is not an expensive meal, but it is definitely not worth the trip.  It's a great little spot to eat at, a close call is having so much seafood with other people.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone and everyone."""

The whole """"wild west"""" theme prevails, and it is fun to think about cowboys and times gone by. I liked the sasparilla when I was a kid, I don't think I've ever had it anywhere else.   Last time I was in Phoenix we went again, and while the quality of the food has maybe slid a bit since I was 5 ( um, I'm kinda a LOT older now), it is still cool. I like the good mood of all the visitors, it's a place that inspires laughter and happy shared experience.   If you do wear a tie, wear one you don't care about, ok. Trust me on this."""

"Update, 3:45pm: This is the first piece I'm going to write regarding the Brewers Guild. First, they're making fun of me. Then they try to downplay the importance of community.

"3,""For those of you who are not familiar with the restaurant, here comes the fun!  I am Ashley and I am cooking for Kelly's Bazaar!  I have owned and operated this restaurant for about 2 years now.  In that time I have enjoyed dining and cooking for Ashley as well as my husband.  In order to stay current on the quality of food at fair prices we needed a restaurant that could keep prices down and keep up with demand.  Over the past 2 years we have continued to improve our food and service, but we still felt that we were still below other restaurants in the city.  In order to keep our voice down I am going to go out on a strong saying that I am at the Cowboy Cafe and not at The Cowboy Bazaar.  I arrived at the restaurant about 5:30 and was not impressed.  I had just exited the bar and when I entered I took my phone away from me and started looking for my dinner.  The menu was very similar to what we had at The Cowboy.  There was a section on salads that I was not impressed with but that I really enjoyed, and a section on pizzas that were good.  I ended up ordering the Pita 3 time and having a fantastic pizza.  That was all.  Not many other places that I go.  My experience with the Brewers Guild is that, in order to keep costs down, they need support from the outside world.  They need to be fair to all members.  They need to have a high level of service.  That includes keeping costs down.  That is the only way I can justify spending $325 to $330"
I'm surprised nobody's complained.
"3408""This place has some EXCELLENT, LARGE, and MEATY burritos.  I was also kind of disappointed that the fries were DELICIOUS, PEANUT, and SOOOOO good.  Seriously good potatoes.  Nothing fancy, but enough to make a big difference in my opinion.  Also, they had so much batter in them, I had to substitute plain flour for a little bit of flour, and to a lesser extent, soot.  I was also crazy picky about how they calculated grease and sugar, and just how clean their china was, so I was interested to see if they had any.  Also, they didn't have any in stock, and they didn't have them in stock in store -so - why are you all so greasy?  I was also super picky about the towels they put around the table.  I didn't mind much because I got to pick and choose a towel right from the start.   Also, they were REAL picky about how much soap to use for.  Neat little surprise that they didn't anything for my towel preference.  Overall, it was good and meh at this point.  I'll concede that the greasiness factor is a little on the thin side, but overall, it was good.  I'll stick with the dirty, filthy, unattractive, and MEA.  Typical Yelp:"") other than that, no complaints.  The place is small and loud, and it's unpretentious enough without sounding like a snobby."

It seems to me to be doing this for the first time in its 50+ years as a location, but today I may have spoiled it for you.  The restaurant is open Tuesdays (close to 9 p.m.), but we had a late start, and it was really infrequent.  The waitress was not friendly, and the service was quick and friendly.

"I've been meaning to try out M&M's Super Bowl 50 Special, but all I got was a very bad NFL defense. I really liked how the exterior was tan, the piping black, and the look of my scoreless, one-handed footballs was amazing. It felt like a mock NFL game, so I tried to ignore all of the great players and throw on some NFL gear. Unfortunately for me, all of the attention was focused on the interior, so I gave myself a hard time. The exterior was a nice touch, as was the look of my scoreless. I was surprised that so many people kept coming after me, but it was mostly just eyes. I really wanted to like Eli, but he was so skinny, had too many bows, and his hair was long, thin, and messy. He was really enjoying himself (and me)! I don't think I would go back! The NFL should do a better job of standing up for the players, and for the environment."""

I think they have been very thorough in their explanation of why their product is superior. They give me lots of different suggestions for improvements, but I can say that they have consistently provided solid, information-rich testimony.   I highly recommend going here if you are in the market for a home. It can be pretty loud, but you can clearly see the products in my way (the one that says Independence Day in the title).

You can get it at the counter or at the bar. They're rather large and well manned. My friend got a horchata for 20 bucks and it was a lot more than $5.00. Sidenote: I don't get it.

I came in thinking I was going to be a picky bridal girl, but they didn't welcome me. Not at all. I sat at the bar, and the hostess had to ask a table member if she could come back after getting back from her drink. The bartender was daft, and didn't seem to care about the customer service. I was completely wrong!  After the show I was so disappointed. I don't get it. The food sucks. The bartenders were so incompetent. I walked out of there with a bag of grapes and a plastic bottle of water on my back. I will never be the same.  I'll never be the same.  I don't get it. The bartenders are so stupid. I walked up to see if I could speak with one of the bartenders, and I didn't hear me. BAD!  So I walked over to your kitchen and made my own wafers.

The decor is welcoming and they have a lot of fun nights there.  The place is about the size of a small apartment's living room so getting a seat is pretty much impossible.  The martini's are good, the martinis don't taste as good as one might hope for a good good Italian place.  The bathrooms are small, too. The marble counter tops are TENAIL (tables of Quality Inn products), bigger than the next Jimmy John's.  I've wondered why there's a neon light at night but it seems to be working.   The valet service is a mixed bag. One night I was standing right in the way of a caroming my way through a groupon, the other I was standing right in the middle of the party.

"U.S. stocks closed higher Wednesday, settling back into a new low after the U.S. House of Representatives passed a tax cut package for the middle class."
"U.S. House Republicans have been pushing a tax cut for years. In the last few years, the corporate tax rate has dropped to 24% from 39.6. But corporate America has been hit hard by the Great Recession. And the corporate tax cut has been tough on the high-income brackets."
"The corporate tax cut was supposed to be a part of the tax package in 2010, but was cut in the final year of the deal. But, a deal was made to keep the corporate rate at 24.6%. Now, the marginal rate is 39.6% and the marginal rate is 39.6%. So, for the middle class, the corporate rate is 39.6%, but for the top 1.5% it's just 9.5%. That's pretty much it."
"The real surprise, though, was that the corporate rate was only 9.5%. Why is that so-so? Because in theory, if the tax code kept increasing in size, the corporate rate would have been 9.5%. But the tax code didn't give the middle class a raise. It cut rates very little. And for some people, it actually kept going up. So, for some people, the marginal rate actually went up. That is, if you worked for a company that went from being a small grocery chain to being one of the most profitable in the economy. That's pretty amazing. And for some people, their monthly checks actually grew last year. That is, if youorted by size of pay, or if you were directly responsible for paying for a vacation.

I got to pick out a bunch of things and I couldn't have picked any other place in the world.  I can't wait to go back.

"I was reluctant to try the Soda Pop because it comes with a strawberry-raspberry-orange Raspberries ice cold drink, but after tasting it, I thought it would be a pretty good balance.  The ice cold strawberry is actually pretty good.  The problem was that first sip was sweet, which was unusual since I have not tried the Soda Pop yet.  But the next sip was amazing.  I was ready.  What I ended up with was a little after 10 minutes of drinking, my exact time was up to me.  It was pretty easy given that I was with 3 other people.  The ice cold strawberry was fantastic.  The raspberry Raspberries were very good.  The orange peel was a little dry, but it was very good.  The ice was still cold, about four minutes, and I wasn't even halfway through my second sip.  That is just about it.  Overall, a solid four or five drinks for just about any occasion.  Would've given it a five, given the strawberry/raspberry balance."""

We came here for a dinner and wanted something different with a side of cottage cheese. The hostess initially was not impressed and argued with us about the side, but as we walked us out he reassured us that we would come back with something better.  We declined and walked over to the other patio seating. A few of us went over the menu and left without paying, leaving us with only the say ""What about burgers?"" and the attendant insisting that we order something else.  We left with a message that read in part: """"We are not interested in having someone else serve as chef/server/server/server. We want our food.""""  We then decided to order the burger and side of turkey and have our say the gourmet. The lady at the other table replied that she was not a chef and did not know what a chef was.

"It's been almost two years since I wrote about Path, but I never made it to Path Basel without giving it a try. That's a long time ago, but it is still true. Path was supposed to be a casual five-star hotel, but with so many options, it became very popular. Today, the hotel is considered one of the top five travel agencies in the world, and we come often to play host to great experiences.   With so many rooms to choose from, you might as well take the limousine ride to Basel's exclusive bar.  The bar is a dreary, dingy, beer-soaked bar, and the waitstaff are impeccably dressed. I have never been a happier campervanerer.  If you can walk, get on the limo. You'll be back to take advantage of the gorgeous scenery in the Hotel Parc des Garçons' beautiful hotel.   With room after room the hostess tips her hairdresser off-texture and the hostesses flock to orgasmic nibbles on their lingerie. It is here that I learned the name, the rooms are so blunt and unattractive and there is something oddly intoxicating about them.  If you are as soaked in the detail as I am, I would recommend The Hotel Parc des Garçons or The Parc de la Sarthe.   Path is a quaint little town in the middle of the Mojave Desert. It is also one of the few places in the valley that has the recently opened, and remains-unopened-airport-style-pedestrian traffic ticket.  Path's economy lane is a two-way street that cuts through the quaint but exclusive Village Inn.  Innkeeper Ginjiu (who I respect) fills you with anticipation and relief when the sales staff greets you. Welcome, entry-level hotel. The visitor is welcome. Prices are reasonable, room and board: casual $50; senior $65; veteran $115.00. Rooms are confirmed and current as of July 1, 2005.  There is a 2% ATMling fee.

"DELICIOUS!  I was in town for a business meeting and had just purchased a used car.  The sales guy at the next store asked: """"So,""""  do you sell cars?""  I said no thanks in a very sweet but personal way.  He reassured me that we could easily be a full service dealership and that we were.  I don't think I have ever had anything against a dealership being a place where I can get car care and when I do find out that they are not.  They are a few miles away and I stopped to talk to a few people there.  Dealer after dealer told me they were going to like it because they were one mile away and that being a dealer was a little awkward.  I agreed to be their car care representative and they confirmed that they were indeed a dealership.  They were kind enough to have a little video where I walk you through doing it.  My goal was to get a feel for what exactly making a salesperson a place where they can get a car is like...I don't know, like making a cake...it's a lot more fun if you get to drive the car.  The standard sales pitch is that they get a sense of humor about a car, which I think is a good thing.  If you're car care, expect a little show and a high level of customer service.  If you're not a car care person, expect rude customer service.  If you are a car care person and drive a fender bender, expect rude and/or harassing customer service.  If you are a car care person and drive a corporate, union, or other non-union car, expect rude and/or harassing customer service.  If you are a car care person and drive a rental car, expect to be called upon a lot more often than other car people.  If you are a car care person and drive a business and hate being called upon, expect rude and/or harassing customer service.  If you are a rental car and hate being called upon often, expect to be called upon only a few times a week and expect very little customer service, drive safely and always, always be prepared for any sudden"

"The planet is flat and with a little breeze, it's quite a pleasant place to stay. It has a very nice large enough fireplace with a nice soft leather interior, and a great many cages and linensacks to accommodate your size.   There is, however, one major problem with French Poly vacation homes: they cannot have all the necessary items for a full on domestic vacation. This means that if you have a family holiday coming up, then you must get an imported vacation home as well as a local one. This leaves you with three choices - buy in bulk from the renters here, have them ship their property to you in the fall and then have them go to town on the property in winter and so on. There are advantages to having multiple people live in one house - you can prepare meals ahead of time and manage separate check-ins so that you don't have a bubble of late arriving food, it's much more manageable. There are also disadvantages, such as the need for a major renovation after a winter that could outlive your one-year lease.   Currently, the house is on the market for $2.25 million. That's just $500 less than the asking price, but it's still very good for coming to California. We'll see how this goes. We would definitely recommend heading here again for sure.   You can buy for $2.25 million and expect a lot of the same things."""

My husband is a big fan of the Pop Up Diner and recently decided to try some of his favorites. He also recommends Pita Jungle for breakfast. My husband loves Pop Up Diner so much he made this little thing out of cardboard that he hung on the wall in his room. He loves the look of it and the amount of paper it came in at the bottom. It's amazing!!  I think Pop Up Diner is the only place in town that offers on-line ordering, meaning that you get your food right at your door, and when you do, it's on your doorstep. This is a great place to go get some breakfast"""

I was so thrilled that someone named after him, Tracy, was able to come in and help with the hiring.  Tracy is a very kind soul.  I am especially fond of the gym.  When I came in Tracy had already packed, so I asked him what time the gym was supposed to be open and he told me it was gonna be closing around 9pm.

"No offense, but I am just plain snobby when it comes dealing with these type of people.  If you know me I would have sneezed on purpose just for being sneezes with respect to a sneezing course I have taken, and I am not the least bit squeamish.  I sneeze a lot, and I will never be completely innocent of the fact that I have actually actually had a sneeze. in fact, I may have sneezed on purpose in the past.  So I am not the greatest sneezee student (I, for one, am glad I ever were one).  But the fact that I have ever-so-slightly-dry, sober-and-just-so-dry sneezes is a fairly unbelievable combination.  And to add insult to to injury, I have actually ever so slightly sneezed on purpose with regards to my dry mouth and nose.  One sneeze, you can realistically expect to have a sneezing attack that lasts for years afterward.

"BLAND CONNECTION - I have been to this location twice and have both times been extremely bad.  The first time was when we were 10 months old, pulling dogs from our yards. We got a plastic bag with a label saying """"Bring Your Own Dog"""".  We got a bag that had a note inside, saying we would be pick up and to pick up a bag of our own.  The bagged dog was very nice, with lots of teeth. He was very happy when we got home.  The problem with this experience is that it seems to be getting old. We got a bag of our own for about $10, which is a pretty decent price for a small bit of food.  The second time was much, much worse. We got a bag of our own for about $15, which is quite a lot for what you get at the grocery store.  We got a bag of mylar for $13, which was a lot more than we were making.

We don't recall any of the fine-grained taste assessments that other dining facilities receive.  The staff was kind enough to walk us through our fix.  Unfortunately, it didn't look like it. We're used to dining in hotels being private with people paying for reservations. This was no exception.   The bed was dirty too. I was completely burned out on this kind of thing.

"It has been a while since my last update and I was still trying to figure out what was wrong with my eyesight.  I finally went here today after awhile because it was me and my friend's birthday and we could not have wished it up a little better.  We went into the back of the store and got an envelope with a coupon for a 20% off gift card to anyone who filled out a online application.  We were told that the card was only valid in the back, which it was, and that we could still use it for purchases of any kind.  That's when we saw:)  1) An amazing selection of eye cream 2) An amazing selection of eyebrow wax (I didn't even think wax could do this, but it did it for a reason and it glistened like a dew-wooled candle.  It was a pretty amazing gel candle with a very dark red flame and a cap that looked like a cross between a phthalate and a miasma sufferer mask.  We also got a wax bomb (dry powder, beeswax and a miasma sufferer mouth bomb).  The candle blew our minds and we decided to take a chance on a miasma wax bomb.  I got a wax bomb and a phthalate mask and both were pretty awesome.  The bomb blew my mind and the bomb didn't help matters either.  I am a big fan of bubble wrap and it looks like it can be made anytime, anywhere.  So, in all the years I have been here, I have only used a small amount each time.  I am really excited to get more out of this amazing wax bomb and to show my friends and family that they too can make amazing eye wax too.

We went to another seat and be told that they were holding a comedy club night, but that was too far down the hall and asked to be turned on.  I believe the guy who was turned off was referring to a special hearing that takes place after the movie has been turned on.  The last time I went, I was told that I had a week to get my license reinstated.  I wonder if he remembers me either way.  I worry that if I do get caught up in the ridiculousness of the situation, I may have ruined their day."

"This is the second time in a while I'll review a new dish.  My Favs Crab Feta Satyr Ceviche was my first dish of 2012.  I traveled to Phoenix to visit with my family last year and enjoyed every minute of our visit.  The chef, Dr. Ross,has been a part of my childhood.  He taught me how to cook and cook and cook and cook and cook and cook and cook and teach me how to cook.  I learned how to make Scallops from him.  He was my best friend's childhood friend.    I have been lucky enough to have had him teach me a bunch of things over the past several years.  One of them was the Ceviche.  It is a very simple process, but it is very effective.  It is a great deal more than a teaspoon of the very basic, but rich, Cevi.  It is also very, very good.  I have had him teach me a few things that are very similar to Cevi, but I have also had him show me his advanced coding skills.  One of the things that has fascinated me about his Cevi is his fascination with detail.  He has fascinated me even more when we went to Italy for a bike show last year.  He showed me how he made his dinner dishes.  One of the things that sets a successful restaurant apart from the rest of us is that each of us works hard to create an incredible dinner.  That is, if we are truly dedicated to making our dishes the way he shows, and we are happy with our creations.  This year, we had the choice between 2 dishes.  I have to say the Spicy Chorizo and the Eclairs.  Both are very good pieces of food, but what sets this dish apart is its simplicity.  The garlic and butter is very, very simple.  Nothing special, but what is here is there.  Nothing special, but what is here is here.  The only thing that makes this dish stand out from the crowd is the presentation.  The place does not stand still for most restaurants.  Why is that important?  Because the servers are very friendly and informative.  Why is that important?  Because the food is very good, and because the servers are very polite.  Why is that important?  Because the food is very good, and because of that,"

They have an amazing potato salad.  I liked those little cakes with the mashed potatoes and corn chips.  They were pretty good.

The Lucicic's have greatly improved since Frank's foundation, and they will not be pulling any punches in referring all restaurant pros to The Devil Shop.

"It is a small restaurant with a large patio, perfect for a late afternoon picnic or a day trip.  Our server was Dan.  We had a vision of dining in Pizza Hut before the recession hit in 2010.  We arrived as a group on a server and were impressed by their friendly and attentive service.   We decided to give them a try.  Their signature dish is Turmeric Dressing which is a creamy, delicious, free-range egg that is made with whole plant tomatoes, sun dried tomatoes, clove garlic, orange peel, and herbs.  We felt so taken away with their deliciousness.   We decided to give them another try.  This time, we decided to give them something else entirely.  We decided on Lettuce for the dinner menu.

The chicken was succulent, the chicken was great, and the revin tarts were making us feel very old. It was fun to see what they might be like 50 years from now.

The building is close to a few businesses and has a Starbucks nearby which I greatly enjoyed.  I would definitely go back since I live in the valley and the noise from the Skyhook Inn can be very loud during lunch.  The staff was very helpful and gave me great suggestions for improvements.

"I have been meaning to try out Gabi's Sprouts for awhile now.  They are so filling and come with a hefty helping of peppers and onions.  I decided to give it a try because I found them to be vegan/non-dairy/iced.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Firstly, it's huge.  I didn't even realize it was there when I sat down.  Wow.  Secondly, it's pretty big.  You will not find a place that I can honestly recommend.  In fact, I don't think I've ever been to a Italian restaurant that didn't have a large central oven.  I don't think I've ever been to one that didn't have a large glass of water.  So, in short, I don't think I've ever been to a place that didn't have as large of a menu as Gabi's Sprouts.  What is it that makes them so great? Well, first and foremost, their salads and other ingredients are clean.  They serve very freshly made (and yours!) just like all the other Italian restaurants.  Secondly, the prices are great. $4 for 1/2 in salami and $7 for 1/2 in pasta.  That's just about it.  Secondly, better value for your dollar.  If you don't get what you pay for, I'm sure I'm wasting my money.  Thirdly, their staff is really friendly.  They are very ready when you need them.  It's rare to hear the whole conversation between checkout and eating.  I don't mind paying $5 or so for a basic meal, but realize that's usually for free when I'm shopping for my husband.  I do like paying $10 for dinner, but that's usually for two or three.  So, for the most part, it's your call.

I did get a brief introductory tour in which I was presented with a selection of goods and services that were currently on the market, and how that particular item would perform in market during those time frames.  All of the staff enjoyed asking me about something as personal as a TV set, and I was interested in what they had in common with some of the """"other"""" items that they offered.  One of the items that caught my eye was the Fry's Tablets.  I was very excited to try those, and when I walked in the door I was disappointed that they were not on the market.  The Fry's tablets are a nice touch.  They are soft and don't wilt easily.  They are also gluten free.  The only disappointment was that the price was a little weird compared to other Wendy's locations.  I usually pay about $3.00 for a set, and I've paid more like $15."

I finally went out for a bike demo this past Sunday, and was disappointed not only by the price ($29) but also by the time of ride-hailing's (hot) $50 adult rating. I didn't expect much, and I didn't expect it to be a rollercoaster ride.  I did a little exploring on Etsy and found the following:  http://www.dayton.com/events/en/2010/dec-28/my-lovely-p-dec-28-dec-28-us-first-ride-through-was-fabulous/  My initial impression of the bike was that it was built for fun, and rather than serious riding, it was a compilation of fun and frustration. It was somewhat of a mixed bag, however, since the hub and caliper are both plastic and there was a slight sheen to them. Overall it was a decent looking bike, with a nice looking handlebar. I wasn't expecting much from a 5.5"" hub, but I wasn't expecting much from a 28"" caliper. Overall I was very impressed with the bike, and I intend to take it on an extended road trip around the valley.  I didn't love my review as much as I should, but I finally sat down and looked at the numbers.  The My Lovely P class is a very interesting ride.  The class is run by a very nice fellow named John.  The ride itself was very simple:  Buy a bike and get a quote.  After that, the bike was purchased.  Get a quote from the person who was going to control the bike.  The bike was exactly as stated and everything ran smoothly.  The second purchase occurred on the spot.  The quoted price came in at $449.99.  That's a pretty decent price for a basic electric bike, and it's not a fancy ""eco""-bike.  The second quote went horribly wrong.

"The place is packed, you can order anything you want, and the service is really nice. Greg made it a point to sit at the bar watch while we were there. He had a couple of beers on tap and was describing some of the special beers they serve. Greg had a couple of different styles in his style, and they were really good. Greg had a couple different types of malts and he used regular malts, which are usually good in a lot of things, but not great. He also had a couple different types of grain and beans and upon tasting one of his modifications, discovered a new flavor that had always existed for some time. I think he was going to great lengths to hide the new flavor, but I figured out a way to give him a better photo than I did.  The food was really cool. I had a good experience here. If you're not in the mood for greasy pretzel, or really craving pretzel with tons of salty cheese, this is the place to go.  The lounge was full of people who knew what they were drinking, and they were really enjoying the drink. The beer was very nice, and the CenPho was good.

This meant that even though we would not be returning, we would, we would definitely want to.   At Blue Cheese, we believe in delivering quality food to our guests every single time.

This time around, they came up with a fun new frying dish, called Coolio, that was actually not as bad as some other versions.  The idea of this dish being about getting crispy fries is great, but is it really that good? I digress. The fries are very, very good. I might add later that the cover is crispy on the outside and actually taste slightly sweet on the inside.  Coolio fries are available in a variety of sizes, ranging from large (DD 5) like I did above, to medium (MM 3), to large (ZA 6).  The large size is actually kind of sweet, and the large size is actually kinda sour. I don't think I have ever had a sour fry at my restaurant, but someone else did and it's been for a long time.   And who does not like spicy food?  Well, we don't have that. We don't eat spicy food and we don't eat fry 'em. So who knows? Maybe in a few years we may have liked the Big Bang fries as well.  We don't live forever, but for some reason or another we become like Fidel Castro in 'A Very Fake People',"""

Great beers on draft, excellent selections at happy hour, and happy hour beer on draft.  They are all pretty good, and they have a good selection of draft beers on draft.  They have happy hour at their office pretty well.  They have a good menu with some beers on tap.  They have a nice happy hour when they close.  I can seeably looking forward to a Happy Hour here for a few more weeks.  I'm not a big fan of the draft either...I'll have to go to Happy Hour at some point.  It's a little cuddled up here in the Phoenix area, so I guess it's without a doubt.   Overall I'm very happy my visit to the Mill, and would recommend it to anyone.

Not true.   The lentil ponzu was fantastic. I have been to this place many times and it is always a little disinterested in my pleas for help. Sometimes it is the waitstaff that is gross.   The service is always great and the food is always good. This place is a hidden gem in Mesa and a NEW place in Scottsdale as a whole.

But the great thing is that it was on my list of things to avoid, so I wasn't really concerned about the going price.  After all, I was going to school and I was going to be wearing a eyecandy.  So I was concerned about the eyecandy price.  The lemon candy was a pretty decent price.  But the lemon custard was a rather decent price.  I am just a bit picky about prices, but wanted to be in the know for this place.  To make it for me, the candy was for $15.  To make it for me, it was for $20.  So it was good.  But it was tasty.  I wasn't really sure what to expect.  The candy was candy, exactly like Créme Brûlée, but it was a bit more realistic.  The pastry was Michelins, and looked a little like a Pâté et Pâté but slightly different pastry.  The wine glass was the Boitron, and was served with a dessert of Récit beef on a piece of toast.

So I gave it a 3, giving it 2, and it still didn't like it (I think)?  Good news! There is apparently another restaurant in the neighborhood with similar dishes that is able to provide a similar experience to Pizza Hut.  So if you know me, you know that I love Pizza Hut.  So I thought I'd give the food a try!  My first impression of the food was that it was going to be really bad.  There were bugs on the outside of the pizza crust and on the inside it was painted black.  The inside of the restaurant was very simple, but I guessed it was good.  The pizza is really all right.   It was all right though, because of the glass roof.  I was like it was the Zagat?  Then you know what?  It was perfect.  When you go to the pizza joint for lunch the crust is perfectly round, the cheese is barely gummy, and there's no chili or cumin sauce here.  I was like it was just a bathroom complex.  The beans and rice are here but not here.  There's nothing to distinguish this place from other places though.  isles is a nice little """"doppelganger"""" kind of place.  They do a great job of mimicking the look of a old building apartment complex, yet at something affordable.   I like that they have the signature drink mixers.

Since then, I have worked there in services ranging from provisional to full-time. I joined the FEZ team in late December 2010, and continued to do so as receptionists for the previous office building which had been sold in 2010. During my most recent visit, I was treated to a dinner reception here that was both beautiful and fulfilling. It was a special night for me as I entered into my personal relationship with Dr. Ford.

"In the last year I've been a customer to customer relationship manager for Kona Grill. Since it was closing its restaurant last Friday, I had my reason to believe that the place would be receiving some kind of prompt business from the owners. Needless to say, I was pretty shocked to see them coming.   When they arrived I found out that the place is now closed. They didn't give me any advance notice so I figured I would just walk away from my friends and family and go to Kona Grill.  They did however, provide me with a sample menu and a few things quickly. First, what I found intriguing was the fact that the service it took the place to restore order was just like a marathon. It was a good experience and if you have never been before's experience, or someone who knows me personally, I would highly recommend it. The wines were amazing, the produce was amazing, the staff was FANTASTIC, my wife had one of our first truffles since we were 5, and the atmosphere and comfort of Kona was just too welcome!

"I was ordering a burger and the burger came out wrong. It had been done so many times already and I was never impressed. I was there 3 days with the same burger and the same order and it never got the same flavor or amount of flavor. The bun had been ripped off and the freshness in the cuties had completely worn off. This was back in the day, I think, the bun was great and crunchy and fresh, not as fresh as it should be, and the cuties were still slightly fat in color. This was back in the day, the bun was still soft and fluffy, and the sauce was fresh and good. This was back in the day, the meat was slightly dry and limp, and the veggies were just soothied up and not limp like they were a few years ago. This was back in the day, the major break in the burger was in the interior, where the extras are still there, but now they're more solid and give you something to chew on. This time, the interior was even better, the crescenza had all the basics down, but the extras were still there to give you some flavor and chew on.

"It was fun sitting on the patio surrounded by friends. I've been here a few times and had a good time.  The decor is great and they have a good selection. Their chips and salsa aren't overwhelmingly bad, but I have noticed some people's expectations have been raised a little too much.  We had a good service and enjoyed sitting on the patio. It looks and tastes just like Mission: Tico Valley Park (if you want to name that thing after a specific place).  The chips and salsa are great, and the margaritas are just as good.  It was a good time at least.  We'll definitely be back.  We ordered the perfect steak and a chicken sandwich. The chicken sandwich was overcooked and underdone and under-the-rated, but my friend got the really good Long-Q Pork Sichuan Long-Q. He loved it.  We really, really like this place.

"Ooh! So far, so good!  We stopped in for the first time since our parking lot entrance, and decided to try the Market Street Special. The place was tiny, and very not big on the outside, but upon closer inspection, it became apparent that it was just that big. And crowded. So, we ordered something to go and were pleasantly surprised that the place does not have a menu. We opted for the Sichuan Long Stew, a famous and beloved food trend, which we has to thank for having a good time in our neighborhood. We had ordered the Peking Noodles and ordered the Cantaloupe Spicy Chinese Food dish. Both were excellent. We were given a choice between 3 entrees, which was a fairly standard 3 flavors of cabbage, as I usually do not serve special interests. I chose the Cantaloupe Spicy Chinese Food dish, which was really good. My girlfriend picked up the pickles and blended them into a smooth cocktail. She also got my number for me. This was a pretty standard Chinese food dish, although there was a slight spicyness to it. The Cantaloupe Spicy Chinese Food dish was a slightly different matter. I got a choice between 3 entrees and got the choice between 3 vegetables (I got the chicken, I got the lamb) All in all, a pretty standard Chinese food dish. We enjoyed our drinks, had a nice conversation about religion, and then we were out of the house. We don't really mind if we go to the bar unless we have a lot of drinks, which we did not. If we are having a party, we usually have a bar to ourselves, which is a good place to sit outside and have a beer. We were not drinking beer at the time, but that is part of the fun of this place."

While the Knockouts are not as fun as they once was, they were far from terrible. They just were not good. Now let's talk about NJPW. While the Knockouts were good, the sport hasn't quite caught on as the sport enjoyed in the Valley as it should. In the late 60's and early 70's boom in the TNA/WWE scene really caught on and in those early days of the sport getting your picture was almost as good as getting your life together.

They even has a discount store that you can use when you go in and of course present it with the coolest celebrities from around the world in clothes and accessories. Now I don't mean to overdo it but they do it really nice and I recommend it to everyone.

We don't have a ton of regular menu items to show for our amazing people- we love traveling and are always open for adventures!

"442,""You want food? Great food? Great at it.  We got that for a very reasonable price.  I got mine for $14.99, which is pretty decent for a quick lunch.  The bebop trail mix is a nice substitute.  They have a good quality lamb shank, which you can get here for half off.  You can also get the fry bread, a lot of lamb, that is just as good.  The prices are our only complaint, but hopefully they are on the cheap this time.  Any suggestions are greatly appreciated."""

"As a birthday present, I received in person at the 2015 Las Vegas Annual Capital Gag Order at the Mandalay Bay Hotel & Casino. It was a very special experience. I will cherish every moment of that experience.   I received a certificate from the Las Vegas Historic Preservation Office (HCPD) that stated that the property was sold, and that they were going to make a profit.  I was completely wrong.  The house was sold, and that profit was not made.  Since then, I have been a FULL price owner at HCHC.com and have maintained a level of customer service that far exceeds anything I could have hoped for.  I would also like to express my sincere apologies to all the people that have followed my lead and followed my lead on this incredible purchase.

My alarm clock had been raised, my car was loaded, our flight was delayed, a message had to be sent to our local Time Warner Center, and we were waiting.  By 3:15, we were ready to board.  The wait was excruciating.  I stood behind the passenger seat and listened to the sales representative talk with my phone.  The seat was extremely soft and light-colored, giving it a sheen that some other cushioned seat provided.  The back of the plane was completely covered in flyers.  I stood up, grabbed a phone, and started calling my agent.  """"Uhh.. Uhh.. Wordsworth, Eiffel Tower..    My number was on a roll of tape, and I was told immediately that I had won.

"You know the saying don't mess with my food, but you don't need to, because I'm serious about my food, right? I've been to a Whole Foods, and I can say that I've been to Trader Joes more times than I can count, but none have been as bad as this one.  I got my goat once, and I don't think I've ever felt so taken care of. Sure, there are the attendant ugliness issues, but let's just say the food never tasted like home. In truth, if you could only wear a Guy Fieri tie, and wore one with the goat cheese on it, and goat cheese was on it, and yes, goat cheese was in all of the goat cheese sandwiches, and yes, goat cheese was on the sandwich, this would be it. But no.  This was truly a community place, and for breakfast, I had this amazing dish with my friend. We both loved this. I got a plate of my friend's favorite Italian bread, the Domini. He loved it too. We both took the time to check out the breakfast items, and I think he was more than pleased with his selection. He got two breakfast rings, two rings of his favorite cheese, two rings of his favorite meat, and one of his favorite meats were the Carne Adovada. He also got two pieces of his new favorite cheese, cheese gelato.  This was our third trip here, and I've never had anything to complain about, other than from the staff. That being said, I wanted to give it another try. This time, we decided to get dinner for a friend's 50th birthday party. We had a fantastic experience, and we would definitely return.  The block has changed since our last visit, and I am very happy to have had a full service restaurant there. They are very attentive and the waitstaff are very friendly. I would definitely come back, because I have made it this trip once or twice, and I am extremely happy I did. The register then changed places, and I learned that the restaurant charges a parking fee during our stay. If you want to park in front of the whole world, however, you have to pay for parking.  The restaurant is very loud, and you can practically feel the heat from the pizza ovens in the back of the restaurant. I would definitely come back, because I have made it this time by parking"

"I've always loved the waffle and the potato salad. I made a special trip this year to Carlsbad because I had a fabulous deal on a Lucy's delivered straight from the freezer to my table. When I arrived, I was immediately greeted with a beautiful girlfriend and two beautiful children. I will forever have the greatest feeling Gold Star motherfu. I will also always have Pink Lemonade and the Poached eggplant. When my husband found out I had a deal, he immediately thought of having a dish made entirely from sourced food. He also thought I'd be the best chef in the world. When I said I would be making his thing, he was very complimentary. I will always remember his excitement when he asked, """"So, do you guys make your own damn eggspray?""""  Well, we have decided to create our own homemade eggplant. It's simple, it's quick and it's absolutely delicious. It was brought to us by a friend who has been making them for more than 20 years. They brought us a tofu dish that was both healthier and more delicious. It was really cool and we decided to give it a try. It looked like a pile of mushy goo on the inside, but with some cheddar cheese and some dill cream on the outside it was just like you get it on. It was surprisingly tasty. The only thing we didn't like was the amount of grease in the coating and the second best indicator of when to open was the appearance of onions being boiled. It looks like you would just be able to grab a few drops of the oil and go. We definitely would have liked to have tasted the eggspray first because that's how we liked it. The portion size was perfect for lunch.   We will be back for dinner and maybe a dessert.  The best part of the dish is the eggplant itself. It's very fresh and filling. It came with a side of rice and some chutney on the side. You can see the rice and some chopped vegetables on the inside. I would highly recommend this for an afternoon with some friends.   We will definitely be back!"""

I use Botox and Face Cream as well. It really is that much better. The only negative is that it contains salicylic acid which is a very popular and illegal ingredient in the U.S.A.

But the spanish beef short rib was my real complaint. It was WAY too dry and without any cheese and the hubcaps were soggy. I was also against the use of ground beef for quick cuts (I think they should be beef with more cheese and less flavor).  But the short rib actually came out to me on a hot summer day and was WAY too salty for me.  I don't like to use the giant bowl system that a lot of the food manufacturers are trying to create.  The short rib is calorie dense and just the right amount for a sweet dish.  The hubcaps are a little dry and the cheese on the hubcaps was all wrong.  I am just not that into hub"

I had the veggie burger which was simply delicious and so far has been very inconsistent at what I have eaten so far.  I have to give them the right pronoun to the dishes because they don't give you their full name automatically so I wanted to be sure.  One of the miscellany items that stood out was the bed in the lounge area which was a total lie.  They didn't have a bed for guests however.  I was surprised that they didn't have a spa or other spa facility with them.  The valet service was also disappointing.  They weren't answering our numerous bank of cards during our numerous trips.  We asked for their current balance and they wouldn't give it to us.  We asked for their current zip code and they didn't give a straight answer so we asked for our current town and they didn't give a straight answer so we repeated again and again and again.

"The second floor classrooms are a work of art.   I first saw them as a child in a Chipotle, and I've since been a loyal customer ever since.  Their freshly painted blocks of chicken tenders were a welcome change from the burnt-out looks of old.  I was a fanboy until I was five, and since that time I've had no one to judge for me.  The Jamba Juice bar sat next to my bedtime story, and my older friends had at least one.  I think the cafeteria was the worst part, as old as the building itself.  The cafeteria was small and barely open, and there was always the occasional sandwich empanada sitting around the corner.  The most basic thing that a cafeteria needs to serve you is that basic sandwich.  There are better ones to go around.  If you can come by during lunch, I recommend Boulders and Slices.  There are also more than a dozen cafes and restaurants in the Bay Area, and they all use the same basic sandwiches.  If you don't mind eating red meat, have a large appetizer, or just aching legs, the Healthy Lunch Series is for you.  There are also a great many vegetarian and grain-free options, and the menu offers a lot more than just quick lunches.  There's a BBQ bar on the roof, a shoe store with excellent deals on upper and sole, and much more.

"The Neon Jungle is a 4K Ultra High Definition (UHD) high school gym.    The gym is divided into two sections.   One side is a medical room with benches and chairs.  The other is a residential area with a gypsy bar.    The gym offers a lot more than a basic bar.  There is also a large inflatable gym dog that goes down to the gym.

They have also offered to drive me to their private jet if I pleased.    I have found their schedule to be more convenient than driving to the resort.   They are not location-based and do not have a corporate jet.    I have been enjoying my stay at the Mesa airport.

I have been fortunate enough to fly to Phoenix often enough that I am fortunate enough to have had a business or personal relationship with one of their properties in the past.  I am fortunate enough to have had a business or personal relationship with one of their properties through one of their properties.  In addition to their properties, they have also offered to lease a portion of my home for a further 6 months if I so desire.

"It was a busy day.    I have been here almost every day for the past 6 months and still get emails from people who are impressed with their coffee, or who have just visited us and want to express their appreciation for the staff and the atmosphere.   Their menu has changed a bit over the years and they are now more diverse in menu offerings, so I have encountered some the other mistakes made in my 2014 review.  However, I am proud to say that I have changed a lot since I was 6 or 7 or 8 or 9 or 10 I did not like a coffee when it was good, or just plain good when it was bad.  I am glad I have had the pleasure of visiting at Winklevoss recently.  The location is a little on the outside looking in, but within walking in.  The restaurant offers a nice patio area and the coffee is pretty cheap.  I have not tried their coffee yet, but I intend to try it in the near future."""
"182,""I have been exploring more of the park recently.  I have been wanting to check it out for a while now.  As I've gotten older, I found me, I hope, to be in the park.  I have wanted to visit for a while and I finally got around a window on the way out.  I decided to give it a try after a couple of other visits.  The views on the way in were fantastic.    The fountain and picnic table were awesome.  The trail system was also awesome.    I was very much in love with the trails on the way in.  I wish I was going to the Fountain Hills Trail Center earlier this afternoon."""

I have been toying with the idea of going to Wonderfully Priced Out Aquarium but the odds are good that I won't be able to find a time until I go in October to catch a few fish.  I've tried a few of the free exhibits, the Keishaographic Aquarium exhibits and the locally owned museum.  All are in excellent hands.  I am a HUGE George Lucas fan and have been since I was a little kid.  I really enjoyed the visit to the Florida Museum of Natural History and the wonderful National Aquarium.  I will definitely be back, and maybe a little bit in Wagner State College."""
"It is a beautiful lodge, and quite possibly one of the best in the valley. I have used it 3 times now, and each time has been absolutely wonderful. The service has always been impeccable, and the wait staff always feel right at ease.   In addition to its outstanding lodging, the lodge also has a number of other great options, such as golf, hot springs, tennis courts, a spa, a elementary school grounds bar, and of course, Ancel the Dog. Don't forget to check out their valet service too!"""

"428,""I was staying at a local hotel and used online ordering to feed my crew. The server was friendly, had a great conversation with his server, and was ready to answer any and all customer questions we had. . .During the course of our stay we purchased four nights' rental properties in Scottsdale, FL, and have been in several more.  We had booked for the past 2 weeks having kept an open mind and having been offered a place to stay, I reached into my rental property bag and pulled out four bedrooms.  The price I received was a no brainer as I had just spent $325.00.  So the deal was, I would stay at Sky Harbor's again and be Grant LAZAM's new agent.  This time I, as a simple person, made the reservation with DANIEL MEADE (Fashion Forward), TERRY NICHOLS (Narcotics Control) and my friend was there to take me.  We went into the kitchen for a bacon omelet (see pics) and while I enjoyed the omelet I was a little dissapointing as it tasted exactly like mine.  I did like mine, I ate mine in person and they had some other nice items in mind too.  I did enjoy theirs I.e. the bacon.  I think I might have downed half of the goods I was offered and eaten them all.  But, as"
"The Beef Steaks are one of those things.  Over there is for sure.  Great service and all of the items are brought to you in good working order.  My boyfriend and I both ordered the Green Chile Stew and both enjoyed it very much. His order came with quinoa and rice - a very good combination and it was wrapped well and had a nice char and roasted garlic egg medley. The green curry had a lovely sweet and kale salad which was a perfect side dish. My boyfriend got the Chicken Potsticker and loved it - a huge amount. My boyfriend loves the Tempe Stew and the Green Chile Stew - his selections were very good. My boyfriend's Orderana was all about the Salmon and I had the Beef Steak (another very good combination). The staff was very friendly and the wine list for the past few years has greatly increased. This is not a stop for everyone - I had the Beef Plate and everyone said it was the best they've had - and they had no problem with it. The Service was very good, they were very quick to find a fault with the sauce, and were very helpful when there was a problem. This stop is for a very busy day, and there is a large group that works in a few hours. This is a great stop during lunch, and the portion size is perfect for a party."""

I didn't have a huge impression on the staff, but the three of us were all very familiar and used to seeing each other. But this was WAY BETTER. The girls were more than willing to help out with suggestions on dresses and size guide, and we all ended up with the gorgeous bustline. This was definitely a higher quality than audition day."
"I decided to try it out after a couple of other reviews which were similarly crap.  I really liked the house tea, potato chip pancakes, and the lemonade by the cup.  The only thing that I didn't like about this place was the buffet.  I was amazed at how quickly my food passed me by.  I almost bit the dust when I got to work.  This was before breakfast, after lunch, and after dinner.  I was totally sucked up and didn't feel like pulling anything out of my mouth.  It was pretty much every type of food from cookie to pasta to chicken.  I did appreciate their by-and-fodgets, and the dessert they had in the form of pears was very different than most boba by-fob spots.    As far as my meal goes, I was pleasantly surprised.  It was breakfast and consisted of something for only 2.5 dollars.  I did end up craving an egg roll, but that would have been about it.    Overall, it was pretty good, it was a little difficult for me to eat in, but it was good and fluffy and tasty."""

"I was working for a large corporate organization and wanted to make sure that all of their people were up to date on all the latest tech, so I asked a client if they needed any help. He was very apologetic and said that they are all ready with the update now that they are supported by their tech staff. He also said that he would take a few pictures with the new system before he left to fix a battery, so you can bet the ponies!"
"The first thing I noticed was that the tables were not always flush. This was very noticeable on the rooftop where the ballroom was. I then noticed that the beds were plain old dirty as mud. I also noticed that the carpet was still warm from the first few days. I really enjoyed this part of the hotel!   After that visit I got a Tracy's A-1 Skylar wrap for $14, which was a pretty good deal. Tracy's was the first hotel I went to that didn't provide priority boarding for guests. I would go to when I was done but they were just fine until I went on vacation."
"The service was very good. Tracy's is a very friendly place. I hadn't been to the other hotels in the area yet and was pleasantly surprised. The waitstaff was very friendly and the rooms were very cheap. The service was very fast. When I went the front desk was filled with people who obviously didn't work for Marriott. I was very shocked that they weren't earlier to offer me a room. I understand that they need to improve the check-ins process, but I was shocked that they weren't earlier to bring me a room. I was very disappointed with the wait staff. They weren't very bright and didn't seem to care for me very much. They weren't very bright either. I strongly recommend staying at one of the other hotels with similarly dimed down facilities."""

I traveled all over the east coast and was disappointed not only to no avail, but to find that they do not have a local menu and to expect me there just to eat a pizza.  Oh, and by the way, the place is only open Thursdays from 4PM til midnight.  This means that you can only get coffee, cream cheese, cream cheese, or cream cheese blend coffee.  Oh, and by the way, there is no dessert on tap.  You can buy me chocolate uringtly.  I hope you enjoy my pizza as much as I enjoy yours.  Cheers."""
"273,""I am giving this one a 3 because I was hesitant at first because I love Pizzeria Bianco.  But as I read the description I became extremely excited and I was in love!!!  I was going to this place only because I had a terrible experience when I came in.  Pizzeria Bianco is a horrible place to eat.  They have all kinds of weird and delicious things.  I was confused because I was expecting very different things from the foods there.  There are tomatoes, peppers, grapes, etc. all over the place.  I was also confused because I could see that they had multiple chocolate bar codes in English and Spanish.  I was amazed that there wasn't anything wrong with my mouth.  The food is good.  I had the pigbaselle, mushroom pizza and the best pizza that I have ever had (on tap).  It was delicious.  I don't know what else has been better.  I will give this place another chance.  I will at my later visits."""
"274,""Fantabulous! That's the best way I can describe the food here.  I really wanted to get a photo of my dish, because it was a work of art, despite just being pasta et al piled onto a plate.

This dish, by the way, was the strozzapreti, the white bread that gets served up to you and around. Oh, and by the way, the pasta"
"It's not often you find a restaurant that I'm quite happy with, but last night I decided to have dinner here. Yes, it is rumoured to be making waves in the dining and bar world, but before you are in a bad mood, get out your phobias and get a good late night  experience. This is a mixed review. Does the rumour come from a bad day? Yes. Does the food run the gamut from Okra to Bruschetta? No. Does the food borrow a theme from New Orleans? No. Does the food revolve around realising your pallette looks like a Roomba? No. Does the food use locally sourced ingredients? No. All in all it is a fairly decent dinner but a busy night for a place that is constantly rumoured to be looking for a new home.  I'll put that on my shoulders.   For the price I'd definitely come here again.  If you can live without cable for a while, or are willing to pay $10.00 for a basic round trip, then you are in the seat of reason.  If you are a hardcore cable snob then you will love this.  If you are a hardcore cable snob and love the cut throat of the BJ's, Goodyear, and A-10, you will love this.  If you are a hardcore cable snob and enjoy the scenery outside of ABN AM, Idaho, and Fairbanks, then you will appreciate this.   If you are a hardcore cable snob and enjoy the scenery in the bar, club, bar, bar, and dining at Fairbanks, then you will appreciate this.   If you are a hardcore cable snob and enjoy the food on tap outside of AZN, or AZN AZ, then you will appreciate this.   If you are a hardcore cable snob and enjoy the food on tap outside of AZN, or AZN, then you will appreciate this, this, or any of the other detracted items on this list, then this is definitely one of the best establishments in AZ.

"On a lighter note, let me just say that being in the club is a personal experience. Being in a club is amazing. It's close to being a sports bar, but it's not as magical as one might think. There are bars and lounges all over town that are both great venues for a night out. There are even that- the Oakmont Hotel and the Four Seasons- that extra night yours truly.  It doesn't have to be the best club in the country, but the ambiance and decor are too cute for their own good. It doesn't have to be the unpretentious club scene that the Flagstaff location tries to be."""
"433,""I am writing review number 43 for my Chianti.  My wife and I have been there once.  We go for a date night here when we can get a drink on the patio.  Our server was not our server.  We had a detailer come and steal our drinks.  We decided to our surprise order of quesadillas, which was decent.  We had decided on Pango Salsa for our entree.  Our server was not our server.  We have been to this place many times, but I prefer my name used here because I can name my guests.  The place is very clean and well manned, save for the detailers.  The place is about the size of a small apartment's living room so bringing a full person to a Chianti is a lot lessening our pleasure.  We ordered the asparagus truffles ($9), carnitas rice ($9), and a side of sour cream ($9).  The asparagus were good, carnitas was too.  We ordered the asparagus fry ($9) and, after tasting both, decided to skip the asparagus and concentrate on the chocolate fries.  They were very good.  The carnitas was too.  I prefer having a server serve me food with my food polite and courtesy."""

Good food, great atmosphere. I had the Ponzi scheme supper. And my all time favorite, the Great White Buddha meal. All of the food is fresh and good and the servers are all nice. You can buy drinks and food is freshly made and good. Oh and the servers are all nice. Some of them are 20's kids. You can even buy drinks at the bar from when you are their age in this strip mall. Chino is a classy place that is a favorite of mine. As for the rest of the menu, and the menu..... well, the interior is fun and the exterior is bland.

"New York Times best sellers, they scored a few books they wanted to review.   It didn't help that they only had one half of the New York Times best sellers list.   So even if they had reviewed all the titles, their only check was how many stars they got for each half.   They got 5 stars for a very short introductory section, and that's 5 stars if you read the first 10 or so paragraphs.   So if you read the rest of the list, you would expect to get 5 stars for each half.  But in order to get 5 stars you had to get 5 books first.  So for this review I've divided the review of Decor by Price and given it a 5 based on their other best sellers lists.  If you read the other reviews first you may have thought that Decor's other reviews were even better, but in fact Decor's other reviews are just as bad.  Decor's other reviews are a mixed bag.  They give 4 stars, only because they only have 4 titles.  They give 3 stars, only because they only have one non-fiction book.  They give 2 stars, only because they only have a short story collection and they have one non-fiction non-fiction publication.  They give one star, because it's short, fiction's best, and fic's worst.  Decor's other reviews are mixed.  They give 3 stars, because they have short, great writing, and because they are short, they give a few good snappy lines.  Decor's non-fiction books are a mixed bag.  They give 4 stars, because they have short, great writing, and because they are short, they give a few good lines, but also because they have some kind of non-fiction non-fiction publication and because they are ugly.  Decor's short stories are a mixed bag.  They give 4 stars, because they have some kind of non-fiction publication and because they are short, they give a few good lines, but also because they have some kind of non-fiction publication and because they are ugly, and because they lack color.

"The firm had been in business for just over a year and was rebranded last year as S&P in response to the company's significant volume targets. In the last 12 months, the S&P 500 index has grown by 7.5% and the real estate index by 6.5% . In the last year I wrote this I sold S&P and now the S&P 500 is worth $1.6 billion . Its value has more than doubled over that period, to $2.2 billion . Its stock is up more than 50% in price since I wrote my first note. And its value has more than tripled over the past two years. Just look at the drool-inducing numbers. One of the reasons S&P has such a strong long-term future is because of fully-equipped corporate America. After four quarters of premium real estate, no one in our country can ever again downsized or underbid for a high-paying, government-subsidized real estate job. And because S&P has more than 2,500 new and existing buildings, they are not only taller, denser, and have more heat pipes, but also more fire resistant."""

Now I have to taste the chicken dish.  The rice was amazing as well.  I couldn't wait to go back.  I bought the yellow dish with chicken and it was out of this world.  Now they have red chili chutney and it is just as good.  I will definitely be back."""
"Please note that while we serve up amazing food, there are some extremely yucky looking establishments in the area. This is clearly visible from the outside, but we were stuck inside until we got to work.   Once we were inside, we were immediately seated. Not overly appetizing, but just right for the price. My expectation was that we would get a glass of wine and a bite to eat. Call ahead of time to find out if your place is open early or if you are yet to see us. It is pricey to go, but it is well worth it. We had Anai"",""Hawaiian Biscuit"" appetizer, two mouth-watering glasses of wine, and two packets of my favorite gorgonzola. There was also a small appetizer made with chicken, a salad, and a bean sprouts. It was a very interesting and filling dish.   Appetizer aside, our entrees were Mutton Mò N Go, a Mongolian beef short rib, and a bowl of Crab Mò Tú. It was delicious. I had the tuna nigri, broccoli, and rice. Tuna was delicious, and the Crab Mò was just as delicious. My husband had the pulled pork sandwich, and the Haribo. Both were very flavorful. My tuna nigri was the better sandwich, and the Haribo was just as flavorful. The noodles were wonderful, and the portions were very good. The staff was very attentive, and very polite. I will definitely be back, and may even go back to Western Kentucky University for a try."""

We woke up to a horrifying scene. My wife was hit in the face, her legs were broken, and her clothes were flying off the building. She was the most vulnerable part of the thing, and she was incredibly stupid. She tried to run away from the attacker, but was quickly grabbed and dragged off-balance.   Breaking Bad is by far one of my favorite shows, and my wife was completely gutted. It was very, very stupid of us not to go.

"To be fair, Tess is kind of a pretty good waitress.  When she's not plopping down at a place on the patio, Tess is probably pretty damn good drinking beer, having fun, and generally being nice and being a good nyyy. If she's not trying to be a Noggin whore, or just a jerk nsfw punks out to, she's probably pretty damn good at that, and if she's trying to be a jerk nsfw and being a good jerk (or both) she's generally been pretty damn good. You can read more about that and her experience at Tess and her here being a jerk here. Tess is also probably good with cats, which is pretty cool. If you know cat and gal pals well I would recommend gettingan order of those awesome, red and gold cats. You can read more about how Twin Peaks, and cats and fandom, is connected here.  If you know me personally well I could be quite honest about one thing - but that's just the tip of the iceberg.  For those of you who are like me and don't want to compromise on flavor and quality, or just don't want to compromise on anything - here's a quick update - the regular menu is $14.95. That's a LOT of money for just one place!  That being said - if you're like me and are into food, and just want to be able to get some of the best vegan/non-vegan fare in town - well, here's a $10 discount.  That's right - you can save a few hundred dollars by getting a regular menu.  That being said, if you're like me and are into the game of kung-fu, and are willing to spend more money than other kung fu clubs and restaurants, this is a pretty good place to look for money's worth."""

Add to that, the hypnotic Mojito creations and Ticoz seems like a fun pairing to me.  I'll be back for sure."""

"The menu at this fine dining restaurant is always a blast to look through.  So much so that I was surprised to find my dining room had a menu screen on the side. This was in response to a question on the dining room's kitchen website.  """"I love ...""""  So, I walked into the beautiful restaurant and waited in line for hours 1-4.  When I entered into a straight line, which I did, I noticed that all the way through the waitstaff line, I was also turned down for a spot.  So I walked around the place and made my own way in there.  When I entered the kitchen, the waitstaff were all very friendly, although I noticed a few of them wearing chef uniforms.  They had flip flops on the counters and a plasma screen on the ceiling.  There was a sauna on the first floor that they could get their guests drinking.  I was especially interested in the burgers.  There was something about those things that intrigued me.  There was also something about the fried chicken and the lambic.  In addition to the menu items, there were also photos of the staff.  I was particularly interested in the wall-to-wall presentation of the dishes.  The dining room was enormous and it was great to see all the different sizes of dishes being made.  I was also interested in the color picture.  The dining room was very well kept, very professionally decorated and of course there were many, many color options on display.  The restaurant offers a dinner menu as well.  The menu is very good, I had a battered egg with goat cheese dip and a lemon curd plate.  The lemon curd was AMAZING.  My friend had the pulled pork sandwich and it was absolutely delicious.  I had the bacon strip, and it was a great little sandwich.  The bacon was slathered in a little pesto and it was SO delicious.  My friend had the pulled pork sandwich and it was absolutely delicious.  It was so good, I almost wanted to give it 3 stars, but was instead given a 1-star bacon strip.  My friend got the potatoes (a delicacy in Romania) and it was absolutely delicious.  The potatoes were so tender and so a perfect flavor was had by a group of us."
"The members of the local health club huddled around a cup of joe as we reviewed the menu. Jared and I both ordered the Southwest Double Double, both of us could have eaten it, but I was starving following a bike ride.  """"I don't get to choose,"""" the joke went, """"so I guess I'm not that great at"""" splitting the sandwich.  """"Okay, so Sierra had it perfectly, so a sandwich like that is a sandwich. This one just seems too good to be true,"""" I laughed.  """"Right,"""" Jared laughed a lot.  The combo had a pretty good flavor, and I liked the mac and cheese quite a bit. I had a light sweet potato fries, which were quite popular among our group.  The lamb shank, a burger staple that almost screams GREAT DELICIOUS, and, of course, perfect hot dog (with & without corn). It was a good lunch joint with several other great sandwiches to pick from.  The bar was full, the walls were full, and the tables were all padded for a perfect party atmosphere."""
"246,""Pretty new building and it looks pretty good. The kitchen is by far the better.  The sandwiches have been good and the hot dogs have been good. I think a lot of the good stuff is in there and not in the bathrooms."""
"247,""Stopped by for a bite on a Saturday afternoon. Cleaned my purse after a long drive. Very inconsistent service with the exception of the woman who comes by the bar almost every day. She always answers the phone and takes my order, but she never answers the window. I have to ask her that question a lot. She always ends up being behind the bar anyway. Very thin, built, and handsome. My bartender always is Apt. K. Smoothie is always the best.   When I asked for the blendys with brougham and rye, he said yes, but since I had asked for brougham, I thought I was getting it right. He also said that his is one of the nicest purses I have ever had. I was pretty sure that they were $13.50. Guess it's the spice level that matters."""

"I have had very inconsistent results on the fly from the match officials.  Over the years, I have dealt with people who mistook my Fishtail for a Crab Biscuit,  and someone else who at one time had ordered the Chicken Parmesan in a salad, only to find out the Parmesan was actually a chicken salad ribeye, and that it was actually a crab biscuit.  Over and over again, they have to tell the server and the server boy that the ribeye is actually a chicken salad, and when they finally say """"Okay, we've got it"""" the dish gets even worse.  Sometimes the server girl is so impressed with the food that she tries to impress me by giving me details on how she got the job, but I'm always stuck as if she's said """"Hey, how do you like the chicken here?""""  In fact, she's become so annoyed with me that she has even asked me to come and see her there.  If I were to describe the food here as 'fabulous,' it would be a bizarre combination.  The place is large and outside of a hotel.  The service is extremely fast, but I would describe it as 'good' for coming here.  Service is shallow, like waiting for a bus to take you, and usually won't be attentive enough when you try to buy a drink.  The food is dry and without any sauce at all.  The salad i ordered today was the worst I have ever had.   I have had chicken and beef at the same time, once or twice, and never once during dinner.  I have had the fish tacos at the same time, once during dinner and once during lunch.  I have had the veggie burger during lunch, once during dinner and once during lunch.   To really make a dent in customer service, we have to make room for all of our friends.  If we are going to be here for dinner, I would expect that we are going to split the price, especially since we are going to the bar and they are giving out free samples.  However, we are splitting the drink cost too.  I would expect that if we split the price of the drink between the three people, they would split the free drink half too.  That is not going to be the case.  I really am tired of having to split the cost of a drink between people who know nothing about one another"

I ordered the asparagus & spinach combo, and was pleasantly surprised at the many flavors! The asparagus was delicious, and the spinach was a bit dry, but decent amount of it. The only thing that I had that tasted very okay, but didn't need to, was the chocolate chip cookie. I don't need to, but would have liked to.

This is very convenient during the lunch rush as the table wait is minimal and there is no food poisoning from waiting customers. We are very fortunate that our family is not contaminated during our most recent visit.   We do wish to add that every time we go to the golf course we are seen as a frequent customer.

It makes a nice gift, too."""

I headed over to the local Herbenden Center to see what they had there.  Dustin was there with some friends...no, he was not there.  We decided to our own our own table and see what they had there.  I'm not sure what it was about the wood paneling, but I'm sure it was just that - panel.  So we decided to forgo the moment I wish I was sporting a pair of my favorite pair of Calvin Klein sandals...which is how I felt afterwards.

If you're after Mediterranean or lunch special, this place is certainly not a bad place to go.  But if you're more into jazz or coastal cuisine, this is a very nice spot to stop by.

"136,""I don't usually review movies and shows very often, but this one actually met my criteria of being a fairly average moviegoer for the place.  The first act is actually quite good.  The opening moments are entertaining and full of life.  There's moments where the setting is different from other SF movies, but none where I saw anyone else die (which is a pretty good sign).  There are also moments when the setting is significantly cooler than the one in my neighborhood, and then a pause or two to consider whether to go with a sunrise or sunset set.  And then there's moments when the set decoration is just right: the gold leaf quill work, the snow globes looming over the valley floor, the pottery casting on the ceiling...they were fun times.  But the best moment of the movie is the one at the end, when the white screen and red lantern shining off the window were beams of light out of the movie and away from my vision...a very sad moment.  I'm not sure I would have made this movie if it weren't for the wonderful people at Fandango, the folks at Matt's and my girlfriends at JJ Abrams.  This is a movie about love and attention, and it's a very special time for all of us in attendance.  Oh, and the Actors Gold Medal is on the wall as well! It's a very special moment for one of my girlfriends and I, as well.

Their salad is simply the best in the state and fills a huge amount of salad-sized calories.  If you go at lunch time get the large block salad or the small block strawberry.

"359,""I've been to this restaurant twice, once for a person and a baby and I can't think of a dish that I have been extremely unhappy with.  The dish that provided the most annoyance was the fried calamari. I was MINE. I could have eaten through the whole thing, but then I think I would have gulped it down.  So I went to the bar to have a drink and to pay homage to the greats. I could not have asked for a better night's sleep than this calamari.  It was very good, and more so, very bad. The bad news is that they never once returned my calls or emails. They were often returned with, quote, ""How are you doing?""""Nah,"" I replied, in a very casual tone, ""we are just having a beer.""  This was only a small sampling of the things that I experienced at this restaurant. Most importantly, I cannot tell you how many times I have said to myself, """"I'll never ever eat at this place again"""" and have wondered, """"what the f--k are you doing?!

"The best part of the whole experience was being seated at a restaurant with so many other wonderful people. I mean, I knew we were going to be drinking and we started out with the complimentary Blue Note, which was delicious.  And the family meal, which was absolutely delicious, but soon veered into some tragedy.   I know many of you are great, and I'm sorry to say that I was not the only person who felt betrayed. Many of you were just as bad after having their money's worth of food at mind you. Many were just as bad after receiving their meals without even meeting the little people. And many were even worse after receiving the disgusting dishes they thought were fresh and were instead disgusting.  So, to wrap things up for the uninitiated, here are the bad experiences.  The waitress was on her second day working there and was not familiar with the menu or even know that I was there.  I regret that I said goodbye.  I don't know that I have ever been in a restaurant full of people who hated me so much that they began to mock me.  I don't think I ever would have imagined that restaurant would be so bad.  Service was horrible and the staff were terrible.  I will never be the same.  It was really disappointing to read the comments online.  I have been an employee for less than a year and have never been treated fairly.  I felt as if I was punched in the face, kicked, or had my arm chopped off because of a rude comment I made a while living in AZ.  One time, a girl at the front desk told me, """"You know, bitch like a bitch about being treated fairly in this country!""""  I told her to get her act big and put a stop to it.  The front desk girls didn't seem to like my assessment.  """"You are a bitch! You are a disgusting, disgusting personification of a people! You are a disgrace to the country and to AZ!""""

They bring us a delicious seafood curry with gal nam, a lime cocktail, and a limeade glass. It's all very fair game, but just because we like curry doesn't mean we should pay RM$ for it.

"It's a restaurant where patrons can order food from various locations from their carboy until about six in the morning, when they are most likely to notice the newly opened Seafront Pub and the fact it is about six in the morning. It is a pretty big dining experience, with seated options from two to six. I can't speak for the types of food selections that will satisfy everyone's particular tastes, but I am told that the menu offers different tastes in different dishes. Given that the menu allows guests to choose from a selection of three or four main dishes, I'd expect something a little different with each. For starters, the rice is edible; it's not as black and white as some other types of Chinese food, but it's decent enough for what it is. Finally, there are the lettuce, about a quarter of it white, and the petals of Chinese medicine plant. I'm not sure that I would go there again, given the quality of the food, but I certainly wouldn't be where I am right now. Still, it's a nice place to go and something worth trying.   I'll let the menu stand while I review it, but I'm interested in seeing the menu and the overall experience. As for the location, it's a matter of seeing and saying the least. Given the location, the quality of the food, and the volume and quality of the food, I wouldn't mind being there.   Oh, and by the way, the menu bar is the only thing that impedes my escape from this place. There seems to be one or two staff at a time."""

"It's a cafe on a secluded island just off the Arizona/California border, just off the coast of Mesa.  It's a place of many memories to those who have visited Phoenix.  Many memories.   The strawberry sundae is simply amazing.  My all time favorite is the huge plate of Geckata I had at the beginning of our trip.  I was so blown away by the Geckata sundae that I made a special trip to this place just for us.    The place is very busy and I was not able to get a seat on the bus because the lane was so busy.  The manager was not very helpful however, she was very helpful to us when we were just starting out in Phoenix.   It was so so so okay when we walked in that it was the 100th time that we had worked here and 50 years ago today was the start of the end for many a person's life.  It was a time when chemical companies were born and that American a caesar sandwich was the future.    The seating areas were very small and very dirty.    The workers were very kind and did not care how we felt about our work.    The vintage clothes we were seeing were from the '70s and '80s and had very dirty or moldy feeling flooring or anything like that.  Some of the clothes even had holes punched in them in the plastic exterior.    The bedroom had a fabulous vintage bed frame that would hang from the ceiling.  We had so many memories of this place and its people...the decor was wonderful, and the workers were very kind and did not care about our work.    The place does not get enough love!"""
"The best part of the meal is the service.  My husband and I like to take our dogs to the park, play, eat, read, etc. Our favorite was the bite-sized piece of meat called the Kobe beef sliders. My husband thought they were so good, he even went as far as to ask a chef about them.  But, what made our favorite bite was the combination of meat and fish. I think Kobe beef sliders are the most flavorful and juicy dish we had at dinner. We also had the perfect amount of CenPho (the flavor-addressing soy sauce in a pho). CenPho is simply delicious! There is nothing better than a late lunch in Phoenix, and I suspect I'll be back soon."""

I did a little trim last night and was pleasantly surprised since I had seen other plumbers do too. They are very warm and breathable, which made the job a little bit less nerve wracking.

They seem to be taking my every demand very seriously.  If I'm going to pay at all, I rather go to the branch of A&E at 7800 Broadway than to The CenPho.  If you're coming in mid-season, I would expect a 40% refund because the CenPho is CLOSED until the season finale.  If you're coming in late summer/early fall, you may wish to buy a second tranche of tickets.  The theatre is very close to Soldier Field, which is one of my favorite cities.

They expect you to be a shopper and to be a shopper.  They expect you to be a shopper and to be a shopper.  They expect items to be of reasonable value.  I was a bit disappointed with Costco because I thought other chains would too too too fast charge for these things.  In fact I was charging $14.99 for a basic air conditioner and that's only going to get better.   In fact I was charging $19.99 for a full on kit.  That's it. That's all I got for this $14.99 price point.  I got to pick from two different brands: Boulderscoast, and Chanel.  I got to choose from three different finishes and I was there during the day and wasn't able to use the bathroom or as a base for my choices.  The bathroom was fantastic.  The mirror was fantastic.

There's nothing I could do but LOL when the breakfast menu plopped on top of one another, I would rather watch a Lifetime Movie the next day than deal with the incessant menu changes. Rachel would come by at exactly the wrong hour for a restaurant, and I'd have to ask her to get her shift started. The place is literally 90 minutes old, and the staff is generally decent. Unfortunately, I have to wait in line every few minutes before they can get to my order. It's a little uncomfortable when you're waiting, but once you're in it's your turn to come by, stand in line, and serve me. I'm the type that watches movies on demand, so it was perfect. Rachel would come by most days just to introduce himself, but he was always by by and very quick to recognize me. I really like this place, and it keeps getting better and better.

We also charged for a TON of SpaDVie products, which is a pretty nice accomodation.  We didn't spend all that much, but we did spend a nice sum of money.  Definitely don't go anywhere else!"""

I feel as though a large part of what made the 9/11 Memorial Day weekend so special is that there were only a very small number of people there. In theory, we should all be celebrating. In practice, however, we simply couldn't get enough Neo-Nazis and white supremacists on the day. To celebrate, we just compelled the bar to close. To true Neo-Nazis and white supremacists, we implored them to stay open. To those in attendance, we implored them to stay open. And to those in attendance, we implored them to stay true to their name and stand for America First!  It was a total and complete failure on the part of the architect of this wonderful day. To those in attendance, I would ask you to join me in returning, as I believe in American Independence, and I am certain that you will join me in joining the people of Arizona in standing with them on this Day of National Remembrance."""

The rooms have a large mirror on the wall that shows you how you looked. I liked how the beds were made from 100% cotton and there was a bed made from 60% silk bedcovers. I was pleasantly surprised that the gym is off season though as there is a water fountain and ice machine. The towels are standard for a girls' gym though so I wasn't worried. The girls also liked the beds so much that they asked me to dress up as the body double for the fun set.

So, on Thursday night, we got a little trickier.  We got a little table tennis in the living room.  Our friend had just gotten out of town for a few days and wanted to celebrate by getting a coffee.  So, he decided to come get himself some coffee.  He got some coffee in his mail order at Starbucks and started to pour.  We decided to order the Tequila Patron as a side treat.  The beverage was Argentino.  So, he got some water in a glass and started to pour.  We started to realize what was going on.  What we thought was a regular cup of joe was actually a cloud of black smoke.  What we thought was a cloud of coffee was a thick black cloud.  So it was quite a experience as each drink was a little different.    We started with a lightened version of the Starbucks Pure Water Breakfast Espresso shot and then it turned to a dark and scary brew.  We were told that the first thing they would do was to send us into a tizzy.  When we arrived, we were immediately punched in the face.   So it looked like a high school student was behind bars.

The decor was very interesting and I don't think anyone else in the room had seen it before.  We had a great time.  The bathrooms were very interesting and the bed was one that I have used a few times and that is KonaBed and that was a great experience.  The valet service was great as well.

My only complaint is their quantity and quality.  Once, we ordered three soups in one sitting, failed miserably, all were mediocre at best, and my glass was full of sopapretotes when it came to the size of my souped-up entrees. Now, with the addition of stock to round out the meal, my expectations are pretty reasonable. They are more than happy to stock up on something to sop up my soup. My biggest annoyance is that their incessant, but unappetizing, phone calls to customer services cause me to lose my balance, leaving me to my other half to pay the bills, and driving me crazy.  I would love to charge them for the twice-a-day lines, but the real cost of running a basic-service restaurant is their overcharging, underpayment, and outrages on the most basic of meals: the elderly."""

She even thanked us for being patient and continued to provide us with advice on how we can improve our food service.  When it came time to clean we noticed that the sink was dirty and that the dust in the dishwasher was on. That alone made us nervous. We asked our waiter to take the dish away from us and we were not surprised when he did not do so. We decided to order the pizza the next day and then we noticed that the fresh air in the dishwasher was making it appear as if it were being cleaned. That is when we noticed an 18g bag of snot coming out of the sink. We noticed that the toothbrush that was on it was dirty as well as that spot where the back of the throat was getting cut. That is when we noticed the 9.9g bag of Mocha. That is not a full bag of flour however. Those are nice. Those are not gummy bears. Those are not a lot of bagels. Those are just fruit and nuts. Those are just candy and I do not recommend them to anyone.  The delivery was a bit on the strong, but we were able to get our packages in within 15 minutes and our next of kin could not have been happier. They were extremely kind and even got us a bedroom shared residence with very little cost.  I would suggest going to any Mocha and having their front door answered. It is a blessing that the front door is open and the people in charge are not beholden to anyone.   I would suggest going to the bath or shower with them and taking their valuables with us.

I feel like I'm walking up a dark alley when I'm slammed face first into a brick wall.   I'm not the greatest eatery guy, but I've found a way to make ends meet by making sandwiches for the people who are breading and cajoling me while I'm driving them out of their money.   Also, they're charging SH*T on any given sandwich.   I felt like I was walking down a dark alley when I was slammed face first into a brick wall.

"Last night I headed to the Scottsdale airport to catch a late breakfast non-stop flight to Phoenix.  I made it to pick up a small piece of what looked like a small town Illinois boy bandana and a piece of chicken at the local deli.  The boy bandana is the cutest thing you'll ever see.  Its chicken wings are the chicken has the chicken!  Wow.  I went to the airport with a huge grain of rice in hand and it was as if hours were on a whim and I was only there for a few minutes.  I walked right up to the fryer where the rest of the menu was being served by a dumber, more dumber, and more pathetic attempt at a chicken wings dish.  My beef stroganoff was served sans wings and the sauce on the steak was dripping with cheese.  Wow.  This is the level of quality and service I would want from a HAND Culinary Institute (GMTI).  It looks as though the male waiter had a field day.  He was clearly unhappy with my service, his menu and his attitude to us.  He seemed to be having a hard time ordering our food because he didn't have the most recent incarnation of our menu.    He seemed to be ordering less and being charged for our food even though we paid for it.    We were told that our bill was only $20 and that we could have purchased the newer, flatter menu.  That's just fine by me and my friends, so we decided to save it for the next course.  The problem was that our hostess seemed to be writing all of our menus on a napkin and was trying to memorize our menus from start to finish.  When she was finished, she took out her check and all of our questions were answered.  That was it.  The next morning we sat down to celebrate our meal.  Our hostess took us down to a dimly lit room where they kept our computer and made some phone calls to make sure that everything was okay and that we were getting a late reservation.  He seemed to be having a hard time finding our table.    We were told that our waiter was supposed to be the waiter but he was not.

We started with the hem alone, which was like a silk plated window seat. The inside was made from 100% faux furrow that just made me think of Tony, the guy from GoldenEye. The tape around the base of the t-shirt was made from 100% breathable 1/8"" thick tape. The outline of the logo was made up of a cross around a number and a number and a half. The first 3 digits were random and didn't look like they had been written by a computer program. The last 3 were extremely random and looked like they were made for a movie script. I had a feeling they weren't even set up that way. They just kept on writing numbers and numbers. It was awesome. We went back to the hotel and tried on some of the t-shirts they had selling t-shirts. The shirts were so boring I couldn't bring myself to buy them. But the shirts made for a very cool looking dinner table. The menu was pretty simple what you see inebriated people. Good eats. Our server was Dan. He was really helpful and friendly.

I was a little concerned that the security guard, the one who answered the car door, might be involved, but the car did not come off the road.  That is not what really broke my window; it was just me and a screwdriver.  That is not an overly-ambiguous warning, but rather a description of what to expect.  Parking is a tricky concept. When I walked into the store, I was not expecting it to be a lot of traffic, but it was a lot of people.  There was a garage door that led to a large cooler that they had on hold for me.  There was a sauna on the second floor that was supposed to be a poolhall.  The sales were not very good.  There was a dry cleaning store on the site.  There was a dryer station with several clothes dryers.  There was a vanity key expander that was going to expire sometime in the summer.  There was a vanity drive-through that involved a ton of vehicles.  There was a section of campus that was without a water cooler for several days.  There was a section of campus that was without a radio for a while.  There was a section of campus that was without a fridge for a full day.

What happened is, a few people wrote in detail about their experiences with Liverpudlian McGriddle. These people, like me, had no idea what to expect. There was a special introductory section, called, """"How to Lose a Date in 5 Easy Steps,"""" that was followed by a short video where the reviewer explains exactly what went wrong, how to fix it, and how it can be avoided.   The reviews were mixed. One person wrote, ""It took a lot of mental gymnastics to get here, but we just kinda like this place. The bar is so high, the drinks are so cheap, the staff is so hard working, and the outdoor seating is literally DIVE warm.""

I was very excited to try it.  It's open past four.  It looks like someone put a rock on it and it just popped and popped.  The servers were very friendly, their bodies language was very impressive.  The burger was very, very good.  I think I'd give this place another go.  Maybe a partial go.  Cute touch."""

It's not a secret that I go there often and have never been disappointed, but I had a bowel movement on the way in and I am aware that this is not a happy place. I cannot begin to express my glee at the randomness of the experience and the randomness of the decision to go in there.   The music on the other hand, disappointingly doesn't  hold up.  The food is not really on the level of """"Last Chance"""" or """"Hit and run"""".  There are better Mexican eateries that can make you feel right at home, but I can't help but notice the Wendy's and Kenyon Competitiveness Rating scale.   Overall, a solid statement from the customer service representative that """"all the right things"""" were true and that they would be more than happy to give you a sample of their product.  If you are after Mexican fare, consider yourself lucky."""

The White House was lit up with colors and plans were made to evoke the colors of the 1892 Mexican War Memorial, one of the few publicly visible Independence Hall fountains.    But for what it's worth, the glassed gardens of the eastern half of the Potomac should be a little like the scenery of Alice in Wonderland.

"491,This is my first time visiting a Phoenix cafe. Back in 2010 I gave this place 4 Reviews and it was only for that reason - because it's such a big coffee shop - I couldn't decide between 3 Places to Go. Now I always go for a quick bite and this place beats that choice. The Noodles...they are so good. The Kids...they are da bomb! I won't complain. The Noodles themselves are ok, the Risotto...interesting, but not addicting. The Kale Devil Vegetable Mutton Noodles were fantastic. The Kale Devil Vegetable Mutton Noodles are so addictive.

"202,""I can honestly say that my family has not been to the Taco Bell buffet quite as often as we would like to believe. We suspect it is just a favor from the back of the pool that allows for more food options.  Still, we enjoyed our bite and sat down for a bite and a glass of wine. The menu has changed a bit over the past year, but we stuck with our mom's old favorites and got a selection of Arizona favorites. The salsa has totally changed, from tomatillo to cherry to hit or go. The menu was a little confusing, and we have always had a hard time distinguishing between ""good"" and """"bad"" tacos. We expected a bit of the former and a little of the latter. The interior of the restaurant is very much a mix of regret and joy. I have lived in Phoenix for some time and did not appreciate the confusion and disappointment of when some people just had a good time at Taco Bell. Our family was excited to try some tacos and we certainly were not disappointed. We ordered the Jalapeno Chutney Tico Torpedo, a delicious chutney chicken that was raised for 40 minutes, the perfect balance of Ceviche and Tropicana. The spicy Ceviche was just the right kick, the tomatillo sauce was amazing, and the Torpedo was seasoned perfectly. The combination is a family meal. We will definitely be back, bringing the same friends we have been to for the evening."""

"418,""I have been to this place many times and I always come back for salads and breakfast.  The salads always are good and the breakfast dishes always are great.  I have been to this place many times and most times because it is late and because it is a 30 minute walk away.  The staff is very friendly and the food is very good.  I have been to this place many times and the first time was in 2010 I gave it 3 stars. between being out in the cold and in the snow, it was pretty good. in the morning they welcomed me and gave me water, but I would have to ask for it straight away because they were so full. I would awake at 10 and they were full early and I could have easily overdid it out.   So basically, it is good but since it is late and there is no one to drink to, they give you small amounts of food you can choose from. Unfortunately, they are closed on Wednesdays because the State Fair is in a few miles away. I have tried several items but have never been disappointed.   The walls are white with people playing, bookshelves are laid out on either side, and the ceiling is very high and quiet.  I have also wondered if they are open 11 days a week. Some of them have the busiest times, others are the slowest. For example, in 2010 there was such a thing as Great White Way, and in 2010 there were so many people who lived there that it was impossible to bike. I am sure there are many other times like this that make us feel more at home here."""

"The claims made here are simply that the restaurant is hoity-toity and has been since it opened in the late '70s.   That being said, it is true that the decor and feel of the place has evolved over time.  An old school diner feel.  An SF lookalike feel.  A new geek friendly vibe.  Some have actually spent time at the restaurant.  Most of them.  It is a mix of geeks and established trendsetters.  Some have even taken to the bar to watch a game.  Some have even taken to the bar to hang out/chat/work.  Some have even """"entered the"" establishments"" sign on the walls."""

The service was simply amazing; I brought a groupon in for our first date and she was instantly selected as our first date.

I asked for their personal menu and they never have been let in what items are new and used a black plastic plate.   I would've preferred a black plastic plate but they never ever saw my item.   I also asked for their current menu and they never have been let in what items are new and used a plain white plastic plate.

The only negative is that their concierge service is terrible.

"Last night I went back to Seattle for a late dinner. I thought this place was pretty good.  It's across the street from my office but I thought it was just a little boring.  We started out with a good quality lamb shank, rice, and beans. Everything else just came together right. The broth was good, the vegetables were good, but I didn't really care for the broth all that much. I don't really mind much since it's all good. We hit up the wine pub and had a beer called Blue Jagermeeting. We hit up Matt's Pub and had a little sitting. It was a good sized bar with decent lighting and sound. I really liked it.  The decor reminded me of Vanilla Ice.  The walls were white with reading ""DR. JOHNSON"" and there was a wall of wine and beer in a circle. It looked like a Jetta game between the jolly goods and me.  I don't know about the Jetta, but the idea of this place being dicked seems intriguing. I can't believe the prices though.  We ordered the seafood scallops and the green salad. And the chickpeas. And the won ton. And the prices were a little confusing. I don't think I would pay so much for a two piece. But I can't help myself.  Wanna know?  Read on.  I'll start with the Crab. I wasn't really expecting it to be so bad. It was just a little rubbery and I didn't really care for it at all. But when it got to my level it was just so-so. And then when we got to my level it was just so-so again. I don't know how the heck they got it so so so good. It was all just so-so and so-so again. But the thing that really sets this off is that once we hit my level again we never looked back. I hardly ever go here again. I came in thinking we were going to be a tower block, but we actually lived up to that prediction. Over 4000 emails later we still have a house, we are still awesome people, and we are living up to our word count as one of the best comfort food chains in the metro Phoenix metro area.

"I've eaten here a handful of times and have never been a fan.  Their lattes are nuts, they are so full of flavor, I could eat a pancakes with my family!  Their veggie burger is just so yummy, and I have to say it is better than the veggie burger that they serve at Jimmy's.  The pastas are good and close to being pita-like, and I love the simplicity of the veggie burger, and the simplicity of the lattes.  The bowl menu offers relatively easy dining options, and they have a delicious house salad.  The server is a little lax with the veggie burger, but the service is nice and nothing to worry about.  My husband is a bit more lax with the breakfast menu, but everything is delicious and fresh.    I think they are a little slow on the tech support because the waitresses are kind of overworked, but they are very helpful with any business, especially when they need to answer a few questions.    Overall I think Vintage Nordstrom is a pretty good selection of department stores in the Valley, and I'm sure they will continue to grow here as more and more locations open in the future."""

We had wine by the scotch and the wine was very good.  We had a bacon cheesecake and it was very tasty.  The scotch is on the patio so you can enjoy the sunsets and the cool mistfalls of the Arizona.  I have been thinking about going with only one of their beers on draft, however.

The salon is clean and service is good. There is plenty of open air and the quality of the air is in anyway proud.   The deali was hers alone and was beautiful. She also had a selection of silver plated items at a very reasonable price.

When I returned to the kitchen, the food was completely mislabeled as 'Flavorless Mocha Sauce'.  I sent the food back for a different refilling, and the next time I had the same thing delivered to my door.  You want good service and a great service, and I don't see why I won't go into detail about what I did wrong, but for whatever reason, the server chickened out and was not heard from for several minutes.  I don't think I will make a lasting impression on anyone who works here."""
"101,""I'd have to say that among the restuarants in the Tom Jetland suite, Cholla is by far and away best.  Granted, it's not the best restaurant in the Valley, but it is certainly well-stocked and well-attended.  I've been here three or four times and have yet to find anything memorable about the place.  In fact, when I stopped in on a Saturday night 12 years ago, I can honestly say that I had never even seen the patio before.  And, hey, I was there as a t-shirt sponsor: http://www.facebook.com/events/11153680454469632/ * * * KINDLE FOODS (Groundhog Day Muffin) is a staple in my house.  They are FANTASTIC.  I have both Devil's Creek and Sonny's Creek.  When visiting from Arizona, I always take the Devil's Creek bottle opener to confirm that I have at least one container of fresh, cold water for my dinner.  Originally, I wondered if we would receive the decoration, and then some after hearing about it and seeing photos of Devil's Creek bottle opener sales and Sonny's Creek bottle opener sales....our dinner ended up being a hit.  We decided to have the bottle opener sale take place"
"I am so excited to bring you the first in a series of posts on Spinato. I am going to start with the soups. Let me start off by saying that if you want to become a Spinato fan, you need not look further. There is literally nothing better I could have hoped for.   The sweetest of the two breads, aoi nothing to nothing to no sour cream, is also in fact in fact in fact soup. Yes, I said soup. The dish is a simple but delicious sweet sweet sweet treat filled with mushrooms and seasoned with an egg. Sushi was outstanding and the service was nice and polite. The last thing I wanted was for the waiter to be distracted by our dishes and by the smell of coffee. Amazing.   The last dish was the real treat - the seabass. I filled it up with whatever I could find and had it on the menu. It was so salty and foamy it was barely tasteable. I wouldnt want to eat sushi without getting the anal canal fix for a long time.   The rest of the dishes consisted of me feeling all over the place and waiting for them to be served without any particular purpose. This made me so ill, wanting to death to taste the dishes but never satisfied.   Finally, the service was horrible and the hostess unprofessionalized me. I did not become familiar with the dishes until after we had eaten approximately 20 or so.  Overall, I would not recommend Spinato to anyone. Its bland, bland, bland, bland, bland, bland, bland, bland, bland, bland, bland, bland, bland, bland, bland, bland, even better. I will give zero stars."""
"185,""This was my first experience with Lush (with many more to follow).  I stumbled into the store because I could smell it 4 stores down, and I was drawn in by the aroma (I don't even thing I read the name on the sign...I just followed my nose).  I had never seen anything like it!  The giant blocks of white soap, the colorful bath-bombs, the bubble bars (that looked like little cakes), and so much more!  It was late December, so the sales staff told me that any left-over Christmas items were buy 1 get 2 free (what a deal on my first visit!).  They demonstrated a bath bomb for me, and I was MESMERIZ"
"I was also very excited to try some of their bruschetta. I had a challah slut, and my boyfriend was very excited to try some of his meals.   It was very simple: I went to the grocery store and I entered their online brick-and-mortar store. I checked the number on the credit card I was holding, and the number on the back of the credit card said YES.  I found out that their brick-and-mortar store is 30 miles away, so I just used their online number.  When I checked their brick-and-mortar store, they were not opening time. I went to check on them later that day, and they were not opening time.  I called and was told that they were open by the time I arrived.  When I arrived they were not answering my calls, and I said that he was not getting the calls he should be getting.  I called back and was told that they were open by the time I arrived.  That was very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very . . .all because I said that I was not getting the kind of attention I should be receiving.  The rep said that was very poor taste, and that I should be very brief on a phone call.  I said that was very very poor taste, and that I should be very brief on a phone call.  They said that was their policy, and that was very very very very very very very very . .all while I was standing right next to them.

"A couple of weeks back I went to a bike show in Scottsdale and so far has been no success.  I am not sure if it is better or worse than a typical show, but I can't help but notice the crowd getting bigger and larger. I think it was pretty good, but I was definitely turned off by it.  So I went to a show at Cool Jars in Tempe, which is different from the other two, I will admit. Cool Jars is a super cool, hip, DJ set that I consider to be the best Cool Jars in the country. One of the coolest DJ sets you will ever see. A ton of noise, lots of drink specials, and of course, rape. The setlist is BoJack Horse Promised Land, The Life I Had, Dr. J and The Vibes. Check it all out below.  Cool Jars - Cool, Clean and Fun Fun! Cool and Casual This show was pretty good, some of the better shows you can find at this location. They have a ton of drink specials and the cash bar too. I was definetly a nerd when I first came here, but the people behind the bartenders have grown to love them. This is definitely a spot that I will be going back, but I haven't yet. Maybe next time.  Cool Jars - Shouldn't Be So Bad Cool Jars is a great place to get clean and great drink specials. The DJ sets it out be classic 80s garage rock. This is a great place to watch live music. Lots of space and cheap, fresh drinks. Last time I was here was in Tempe, had a great time!   Get there by car or busboy & get there early!"""
"214,""This place has been around forever. I started coming here when I was five or six, I don't recall what it was like, it reminded me of being in Chicago. I mean, there was Pita Jungle and all those tasty Japanese delis. And then there was 7-Eleven. I was like, ""that's too bad, they closed those days"" - and the customer service was kinda on the wane. Just got back from a couple of years here in Phoenix, the owners of this place and our place have welcomed us with open arms. The two greatest memories we have have been coming back from a short distance away. Slinging on a Saturday afternoon"
"The staff was kind enough to give me a demo of their new app, and I was very excited about it.  I recently joined them, and I was really excited about the food.  The booths were incredible, and the furniture was amazing.  I really love their vintage furniture, and I really wanted to like Essence.  So, I got my first look at Essence at a recent event.  I was very excited, and took a few pictures with the new Essence.  I was very excited about the look, and the opportunity to try the new colorway.  My first impression was that was going to be a very different place than it was now.  I wasn't really expecting much, and it wasn't a luxurious look, but I was very, very pleased with the look.  It was a nice, basic silver finish, and I wasn't expecting much.  The two big lampreys that were going to be the highlight were also fun.  I wasn't really expecting much out of this, and I wasn't expecting to lose anything.  So, I was very excited.  ~ Erika Tracy"""

The bar has a good view of the Performing Arts Center.  The place is very clean.  My girlfriend and I love the sports bar and the dance floor.  The place is quite a bit quieter than other places in the neighborhood, so it doesn't matter which way you look.  The food is just as good at 5 stars as it is at 6 or 7.  My girlfriend loves the seared-pea nipples and the pussy slices.  She loves the sticky-sweet cream-and-sauce cocktails.  She really does deserve the Best Possible Price!

"As a tech guy, it's pretty obvious that this is my first app. Back when they were hiring, I used to work there and I still do. I went into their office and I saw this cute little app by the name of Knotty & Son. It was about as far as I'm willing from tech to go and said that if you could just know what kind of job you wanted, you'd probably get one. Not so much. The first job I ever wanted was as a server, and that was in the food kitchen. I always found that to be boring or just didn't want. I really like this job and would happily work there any day. Now I just have to go and pick up food. Knotty's Son is a 3 hour video, it's really fun and it should be pretty easy on the eyes. If you don't want to go, hit up Paths to Appreciation. If not, grab a bike rack and a bunch of hair. What do you get? A ton of questions, answers, and really interesting advice on how to be a good server. It should make you feel right at home. You should be great. **TIP: If you get stuck between answers, ask yourself: WILL I SELL MY NO. 43 OUT FOR FOREVER?  That's right, LET'S JUST PUT AN ANSWER IN FULL THESELVES. Literally, I would buy a new car and buy a new suit and tie for under $70,000.  Not only would that price tag be fantastic, it would also be my first real job experience.  I really wanted to get a grip on the job and get down to the shop, so I contacted Steve D. Dillard's office to find out what was going on.  They told me that they were closing because the workers were not getting by on their wages.  I told them that was just a simple computer error, and that I was sure they were going to be hiring good people.  They said that was just what they did at the office the last time they worked, and that was to prepare the right hiring pitch.  That was some years ago, so I don't think it's exactly what it was, but it certainly was good.  The store I worked at had a policy of hiring good people when in fact, it was a waste of time and money.  I really wanted to get back to work"
"This place is packed.  Walking in, I felt as if I was going to die. I could have easily died in front of me. I was not restrained to any sort of object.  I was not even allowed to shake hands with any of the staff.  The food is decent. Haji and otheraji items are not on the menu.  The soup is decent. Food is decent. Everything was priced fairly and the atmosphere was actually pretty good. I would definitely come back."""
"257,""I was very disappointed with the food here. I had the grilled-chicken breast, a Mediterranean salad, a pork dish and a veggie dish. Everything was just OK, except the grilled chicken. The salad was horrible. The salad was awesome. The service was not fast and dirty. My dish came with side of toast and a vinaigrette dip. Mmmmmm...I will give this place another go. I was here once. I told my pharmacist about it. ""I know it happens, but is it okay if I take home a small amount of the fixings for a small infraction?"""" Your pharmacist works in a credit reporting agency and knows your name and contact information,"" I said.  ""You referred us to a lawyer who is happy to review my business, correct me if I'm wrong, and make sure I am not committing a capital M in my practice,"" she said.

I'll go back for a steak sandwich and a Mexican chicken sandwich. The price also sucks."

I really really like the Rolls Royce with all the red carpet look and all the party.     Amber is the most fun water we've had yet.  I have been drinking it all weekend and it's always fun just sitting there and enjoying the breeze.    The kids swimming pool has been rocking a boom machine recently.  I think they need a lot of kids in there enjoying the pool.  We finally have the poolside pool, good size for a family dinner.  We finally have the bar area where they sell beer and wine.  Overall, was a blast exploring these waters!  I'll definitely be back, bringing a different kind of beer."""
"41,""I don't see what the big fuss is all about. Everyone is super nice and the atmosphere is casual and friendly. But one thing I noticed was that the more times I went that one time was that the owners got really mad at me for not calling them and they started to tell their friends about it. I don't know that I've ever been so mad at a restaurant. At least, not since I was a kid. I don't know that I ever went that far because I've been here many times, and I'm always just pretty bad at understatement.  It can be just as bad when you're not there. Sometimes, the service is really great, the servers are really nice, and the food is just as good as it sounds. But overall, if you're in the area to eat, or just for a beer, then you should definitely check this place out. It's a great place to sit around and have some drinks. And because they're closed Tuesdays and Thursdays, it doesn't kick ass until they're open. You can order there and order on draft after dinner, and it's great that everyone's drinking style before the dinner menu. It's one of those places that makes you want to vomit.  That's why we're going now. I want to give them a 5 on the draft menu and a 10 on the beer. Because if they don't have it, it's a 100% vegetarian menu. I don't care if they have sours or not, drink or food. If they have all the usual drink specials, it means something. If not, it"

I have been to this restaurant multiple times, and the food is always the best I have ever had.  I have been to this because sushi and other prepared foods are not always so friendly after a while. I will admit that my sushi food always tastes better with time, but that is not my business. I have tried a few different kinds of prepared foods, and all have had very good results.

I've been to a lot of the eateries in the Valley, and found the atmosphere to be of the classic 1950s diner-friendly variety.  The beer selection to booty to go around. The menu has also seen a bit of a nerdy take-down dining, but is pushing for some of it to get a little more legibility.  We ordered the family-friendly Tanzanian House Special (with Pita Bread mix to boot) and my husband ordered the Mediterranean Salad. Both were solid.  We ordered the Piperitos Salad, a traditional Chinese salad, and my husband ordered the Vegetable Pibil served with a salad of carrots and cucumbers. Both were solid.  The salad was light and fluffy, and the vegetables were abundant. Piperitos was slightly sweet, and cucumber-y, and while it was not a highlight of our dinner, it was enough to discourage me from coming back unless I was really fancying a dish.  The salad was so good I was drooling due to the accompanying headache.  I was going to have to get a cactus salad, but my husband ordered the Carrot Salad.  He was really good, and my girlfriends first impression was right on the food.  It's a little small in the center of the table, but when you're crammed into a tiny little little table, it's hard to miss.  It was so good I was compelled to order an appetizer.  I had a bunch of school lunches I could use to myself while I waited, and nothing was more disheartening than a dirty dirty chicken sandwich sitting on the bed of a parked car.  I'm so glad I read the description of the sandwich and signed up for a daily flyer so I could get it.  It's free on Thursdays so I could have passed up the deal, but it's a busy week for me."""

Q: What is the cheapest pizza in the Valley?
"A: When I visited the Mill area last year, we had a steak sandwich with maggots in it. That was over $6 for a small thing. In the last two years I have made it about $4.50. That is almost twice the cost of a hot damn within three miles. I would happily eat anywhere with a little seasoning and a few taps on. If the price is right, I will make it my business to get there. But if not, I may as well go to Arizona. I'll be damned."""

I can see that coming.  The menu has some room for both of us, but I really enjoyed the bean quesadillas I got at Dos Equis, the carnitas tacos at Last Chance, and the quesadillas at Barrio Bistro.

It was quite the impressive feat to wear only one thing at a time, and to only take about five at a time.

I was sort of tripping over a Jars halfway house cocktail, so I decided to guzzle a little Haldane without resorting to any kind of bath salts.  I put down my cell phone and went to sleep.

The service was excellent and the bartenders were great.  My husband and I decided to have a late breakfast and late dinner and found our server was very attentive. He was very helpful with advice on new and used cars. We ordered the breakfast items such as eggs, toast, toast and bacon. We also ordered the dinner items such as potatoes and toast. The staff was very friendly and the food was delicious. Our server also took care of our carne asada food late dinner. It is a great place for a late night meal. Our server was very attentive and the food was delicious. We will definitely be back. We ordered the breakfast braised cauliflower (yes we did that) and it was delicious. Our server also took care of the asada which was very delicious. I ordered the red wine deco which was delicious but not anything special. My husband ordered the burgers. My husband ordered the fries. My husband ordered the burgers. All the food that we got our ordered without any problem. My server also took care of our damaged wine glass which was delicious."""

I have been in for a groupon, one time for a small drink, the other times it was just straight up terrible.   I have never been disappointed.  Very few places are full and the staff is very friendly.  When in doubt its best to seek out a separate place rather than rely on Safeway for service."""

"358,Wow!  This was my first time visiting Cheesecake Factory in person and it was definitely not my favorite place. The food was fresh and good. The service was fast and the facility was very clean. We just stopped in for lunch and found out that the cheesecake is made from 100% vegan, grain free, and cruelty-free. The cake is very fresh and tasty. The after taste cake has a very unique flavor and the after tasted cheesecake has a very unique flavor. The after tasted cake was very good and so was the dessert.  What I liked the best about the two different types of cake was that they could combine to create their own unique flavor. The recipe for the after taste cheesecake calls for 2 ingredients; one of them is vegan and the other non-vegan. My husband decided on the non-vegan one because he loves sweets and thought it was really tasty.  I really love the simplicity of the after taste cake and the simplicity of the after taste dessert. What I didn't like was that the second ingredient in the recipe was a little tricky to understand because it had to be vegan and not organic. If you know me I can be really mean.   If you don't know me well I am a bit annoyed because initially I was thinking it was so simple but when the second layer of ingredients were up for debate I am think the confusion definitely turned ugly for me. I would suggest going to a restaurant and learning the ingredients list before coming here."""

The fry bread is plastered all over the place and it screams fashion. The chain opens sometime in October. Fills the need for waitstaff and customers.  If you're looking for youthful charm and thrills, then Camelback is for you. The place is certainly chic and full of energy, but if you're just looking for some good Mexican food with a good soundtrack and a great DJ, look no further.

The seaweed tempura was over priced and overbearing.  The green salad was over priced and overbearing.  The green salad was served with rice and soy sauce was mutton salad, which was DEFINITELY NOT HARD MEAN.  The green salad was served with wafers and seasoned fish was calamari.  The tamales were overpriced and overpriced.  The tamales were cooked to perfection and left behind on the bar.  The tamales were filled with a lovely red-eyed chili and served with a massive swordfish fillet.  The swordfish was a beautiful dish in all it's pure white and red, and the fillets were massive and massive amount of meat and vegetables.

I actually played with it a little bit today. They put some tape around the edges of the beds to help with deflection. I gently poked the tape around the edge and it worked. I am pretty sure it was never more than a slight bump. I am pretty sure it was a small scratch on the bed.. they completely cleaned it off with a damp cloth. I will most likely wear them out using the same bedding but I was pretty sure I would get used to them being soft again soon."""

He immediately offered to refund us the cost of the meal because we weren't 100% satisfied.  After discussing his offer with my friends, we decided to take a 50% refund.  Let me just say that I was personally a little uncomfortable with this because while I have received refund/free meal offers from other businesses in the past, I've never taken them up on it.  I don't think it's about the money and I certainly don't write reviews to elicit free meals.

"The hit TV show Game Changers is called Game Changer Zero.  It is a five part show.  The first part was shot in NYC, and it was shot in a studio in Scottsdale.  The first half of the show, I remember being very good friends with my high school sweetheart, she was the one who sang the first few times I heard the show.   She was also my best friend, she was the one who reassured me that I wouldn't have to worry about an expensive concierge because we would get to wherever we wanted to go.   She reassured me that she would be fine with having a detailer accompany us when we were leaving the house.   The first few times we went, we were a little apprehensive because we were so close to having our special guests accompany us.  The house was completely covered in flowers, which was to my knowledge, not exactly a typical location for a Disney Princess house.  The kitchen was completely covered in dishes, dishes that were famous, and famous bad boys.  My sweetheart, I must have said a few words before we left the house, she greeted us and welcomed us back with a large hug.  We went in and out of the house in less than an hour, and followed it up with a fantastic dinner just a few days later.  What a party!  The food was so good, I decided to have an early dinner here.  I had brought with me a chef's lunchbox which they had at Trader Joes, which was awesome.  The dinner was so good, I actually went into the Best Eastern's and lost my temper.  I ended up actually overcooked because I was so full.  The best part of the meal was getting our food glasses to pick up grits and other critters that are not seen on a grit.  After the meal, we basically wasted no time eating at Best Eastern's again.   They offer a free water glass to anyone wanting to try the food.    I would recommend this place to anyone who loves food but is hungry."""

The exterior was much the same as it should be, the tables were set up nicely and the interior was much the same as it should be.  I was very satisfied with the meal I was having and went with coconut milk for the 3rd entrees.  The milkshake was the star here, I won't spoil it for everyone, but it was yummy.  The service was very fast and the kitchen was very nice.  I will be back for dinner and for the 3rd entrement."""
"233,""Not impressed. Food was bland. Yes, it is Weekday Fajita / Hot Pad Thai / Thai Food the size of their backpacks, but nothing to write home about.  Then there was the tincture. Stuff was dried up and unappealing to us - except for the cotton candy wrappers. Took a little while to find myself a Tincture for Weekday Fajita / Hot Pad Thai / Thai Food, but I guess I like what I eat."""
"234,""What a waste of time. After all the hard work, the hard drinks and the fun Fridays bring, why don't you just have a party and party your wife off!  I went to this place with a friend for a nice late afternoon getaway. We'll be back when we are in the West and when we're in the Midwest and ready to party.  The decor is fun and the staff is great.  The place doesn't have a ton of pets, but they are clean and well manned.  I would definitely come back."""
"235,""I've been hearing about these things for awhile now and when I went through the install phase I was pleasantly surprised. After seeing these things for what they are they are worth the wait. They are simple, easy to understand and very helpful service dogs.  I spent almost all of my time at Cadillac's, however, the dealership, in which I worked, was a pain. There was a conscious decision taken by Cadillac's to make Cadillac's products less accessible to customers who were not served by dealerships like me. I was not pleased. I wanted to leave early and return in a positive light"
"The owner of the place has since been fired. It looks like everything is ok, but everything seems to be up in the air. Not sure if they are still alive or not.  I called and was told that they are still not taking their customers away. I called back and was told that they are still not getting back to me. I told them that I have contacted them and they will do their very best to find me a new home.  They did come back to find me and find out that I am still not satisfied, they took my customer away and that is not what happened.  I call back and they are back to threatening me and threatening to take my customer away. They have not returned my calls.  I sent them a message and they were back to their normal within 24 hours.  I don't know that I have ever run afoul of the Federal 'Filing Protection Act' for a threatening or abusive phone call, but I do that a lot when I do business in general and this place.  I will not be going back to these people."""
"157,""I went here for a business meeting and had a good conversation with some of the management.  I don't think I've enjoyed my visit as much as I would prefer not to have.  The bar is crowded and they have a rule that if they don't have a table full of people that are not playing by the rules then they will play favorites instead of letting everyone else do the dirty work.  It's a total waste of time and money and you should be fine just going there.  Everyone seemed really happy and I enjoyed sitting at the bar.  The food is good though.  I'll stick with the guys at the bar who is always smiling and talking to the ladies.  I enjoy the bit where they have this game going on and they are giving out balls that are scored based on which team is the most scored.  I don't think I have ever played sports with a ball scored like that."""
"158,Got a pretty decent burger and a nice cold drink. Had a beer and a burger. Stuff is a bit delayed, but worth it.  I have to be honest, the food at this place is just mediocre.  Not good enough to put on a menu, and just not anything that I can take home. Not sure I would make a trip here anytime in the near future.  I wanted something a little different though."

"61,""Other than the ambiance not being too different from any other, this place isn't good.  I went here after hearing about Amy's Car wash and wanted something a bit better.  The service was a total disappointment.   The food was WAY overpriced and the potatoes were still on a par with the regular ones.  I was left with a dumb idea - I could have gone to Amy's and gotten a steak, but instead got a beef burrata.  I don't think I would have made that mistake again."""
"62,""I went here for a business meeting yesterday.  The lady was very nice and professional and made me feel like I was at a business dinner.   The dinner was exceptional.  The food was delicious.  All the food was wasted good food.  The manager seemed very unhappy that there were so many food hangers-on available.  I don't think I would go back..."""
"63,""I went to Blue 32 this time around because I have been in a few others.  I like to drive so I can see my way around, and I had a great time. The restaurant is very modern, but good.  The bar is wide and loud, so if you can find a bar, it is, it is great. The staff is great, and the rooms are very clean.  I got a free drink, a small Bloody Mary and a lager (another drink only) for my review.  It was all very drink worthy, and safe...until you know me for sure.  I did notice that the reservation system is a bit strange, and that is just when I was most impressed. I was not the greatest wizarding Steve Jobs, but I was damn near genius.  I do not recall any flaws with the facilities, but I do remember being a little impatient when I got my check.  I will definitely be going back to Blue 32 for sure."""

"The Skinny was the first real attempt by me to describe the look and tone of Chanel. I think it's one of the first Chanel pieces I've ever worn. It has a medium-holro-tinged beige beige pedicure that is as youthful as it gets. It has fair-to-leather skin and is more than a little luxurious. It has a satiny/fiber feel to it. There's a few fine lines of the creaminess there but overall it is as fresh and as fresh as you'll get. I've tried a few pieces and are thoroughly satisfied with the Chanel onyx edging and satiny/fiber line of work.   Chanel is more than willing to demonstrate a more modern and natural finish on any given item. They shine and show through with their Chanel, foundation, and upper.   This time, they aren't about to pass up a womanizer stash!   I am here to show the world that I am worthy of the lovely and talented Horace Chanel.   Chanel is not only gorgeous and flawless, but with every purchase I make, she quilts in my name in gratitude for having her back.   This time, I'm going to be using her foundation.   It is cruelty-free and formulated without synthetic fragrances.    I don't care if the Chanel touches are small (the upper is not only toned down, it is completely noncomedogenic), they are still fine.    I simply don't want to use any of the foundation unless I specifically request it.    I am so incredibly feminine and in love with the color red.   I could go on about how wonderful their toning is, but I'm just too full and complex and just can't get enough Chanel.    This time, I am going to be using Merlot Foundation foundation, but I may as well go to MAC.    I don't care if the Chanel touches are subtle (the sole reason why MAC is so awesome), they are still fine.   Chanel is so flawless, in fact, I could write a book and put all of them together.   I am so incredibly proud to have joined MAC and the amazing team behind MAC Kinetic All-Girl Body Shampoo and Body Shampoo Plus.  I couldn't be happier with how everything"
"I'm not sure that I would recommend this place, although I did enjoy a few drinks and a movie at the bar. We had a deal starting at $5 a pop plus tip, but it was only good for a short time. I don't think I would make a big dent here if I got my hopes up."""
"Uhh...we just went here! Gotta give ourselves at least a 10 minute window to lose our minds-- just to see what we have to offer.   We had a pretty good experience here, and if you know whats good for you, we highly recommend the burgers. They are fresh, juicy, with lots of cajoled on lettuce leaves, and with a great red chili oil dip.   The service was a little slow, but it's a place that's pretty fast, and they have a good selection of beer on draft, which is always a good sign."
"They need to get out of here for 90 minutes. It sounds crazy, but they're the only music station in Tempe Bank. Go there, order there, get a sandwich, and then it's over."

My husband was very shocked to hear my complaint, as it seemed so obvious from his answers.  We decided to give the restaurant a try, because we thought the place looked a little different from the others we've been in.  We entered a restaurant that I have been to a few times.  The waitstaff was extremely friendly, and the waitstaff report that they run a good meal there.  The waitstaff have tasted our food, and have requested changes in detail.  They have also requested that I wear earrings.  Their statement credit program is a good place to start, though.  I highly recommend the steak and potatoes.  They are very good, and I would happily take them to a Mexican restaurant in downtown Phoenix for a more expensive fix."""
"416,""I love this place!!! Lots of space and cheap, TASTY sandwiches. Just relaxin and be thankful they are salame, arugula, and brasise. I also recommend the tortas.ami is delish. And the mango salsa is great. Their martini is great too"
"It's quite possibly the best burger in the world, if you ask me.  I mean, I'm a big fan of the patties and don't get great heat, but they are so rich and delicious. The fries are crispy and seasoned well and the is left-of-center point guard/defensive end combo that keeps things interesting.  Very impressive.  Wait. What is this? A super good burger?  What does this have to do with Golden State?  I'm not sure I want to go there, but if I did, I'd probably at least go try it.  If not, I may as well take a few pictures with the rest of the family.

They have a good menu and are willing to play ball if you can show me your use.  They have a nice large club area with a variety of sports and activities.  If you are interested in playing at Second or Huskydale the chances are that you will like this place.  The staff is friendly and the food is great."

And don't even get into the popcorn, popcorn, popcorn, popcorn, I mean real stuff!  Those are just some of the great treats that the employees are putting up with.  I was truly amazed at how thoughtful they are the people who run the place.  Thank you for being part of our Popcorn Weekend!  And remember this -- bring a crumbled cookie, cash or a check, no matter how good the treat may be. :)  PS - I went on a day off from work today and forgot all about my gift.  I was so impressed with the cards and the way they were written I thought I was cured for money.  I don't know why, but it seems to be working for me.  I will try the cheesecake too.

"158,Pretty new building and they have a pretty good selection in books. I really enjoyed my visit.   The baths were nice and the staff was welcoming. The owners was kind of a jerk and did not seem to care about my wellbeing (I am not sure how he did it, but I do not know. I would have liked to know.)  It's a pretty small place and the staff was pretty easy on the visitor. The owners was not that understanding with us and other visitors.  It is a nice place to stay and is likely to be a little more than fine in the near future.  I would stay here again when I travel the world and enjoy the scenery."""
"159,""I have been to this place many times and I can say it is better than you think. The food and service is always right and the staff are always friendly. I have been to this place many times and have experienced very good customer service from the staff.  The owner, Dr. Chudnovsky, is a good person to do business with. He genuinely enjoyed his business and we will be going back.  I have had excellent service from the Phoenix Hotel Employees Retirement Fund (PHHREF).

When we entered, they didn't have a lot of options but to choose between two choices: Historical Dilemma or Good Will Hunting. Mom and Dad chose the Historical Dilemma. Guess what? They liked it too! We quickly found out that it was a very bad movie about a group of Americans who escape the clutches of fortune and find a paradise in which to live. They are called the Good Will Hunting. So, what is it? It is a very ugly movie with some interesting people and places. It starts out innocently enough, but gets very interesting when we are through. Eventually, we get into a relationship and it gets really interesting. It was fun watching this happen.  We were really bummed because it was supposed to be a fun movie.  We ended up leaving because we figured out what we liked best and we got to see some of our favorite people get betrayed and maybe even succeed in their plan to get back in business.  What a deal it was.  The Show is interesting.  There are a bunch of guys who look like they are about"
"I have been meaning to try out DST3 for a while now. It is a small RC store that comes with several other RC stores. I was hoping that if I were selling things like Snacks and Fish to the public, I would get some sort of title for myself or a specific thing. I was pretty sure that if I sold things like Wipes and Wetsers, or Sacks, or Bags, I would get some sort of monetary profit. In the last 3 months I got a ridiculous amount of emails from people wanting to buy their stuff. They were from people who asked where they got their stuff, asked where they got their stuff, and asked where they got their stuff really cheap. In total I get around $1 from these people. I don't care if they have a gun to my head or not. I just want my stuff.  I even bought a pair of Nike Running Shoes for $29.00. You can find their full range in the Nike store, or buy their brand new website. I don't care if they have a gun to my head or not. I just want my stuff.

The burgers and rice pudding are over priced and your expectations are too high, especially with all the hype around the new Cadillac X.1. Plus they have lemon custard and other veggies that would be great with duck or pork. In any event, the Nasty Bouncers are stock is good, but if you are charging over $50 per burger then you are probably overbooking it."""

"They have menus, they have menus, they have menus.  What I love about Phoenix is their service. I have eaten here many times, and nothing can prepare me for the atmosphere, and staff that greets guests at each visit.  The atmosphere and the staff have changed quite a bit since I last saw Judy. She greets you with a friendly face and delicious salads are abound with peppers, tomatoes, and potatoes. Her husband, Matt, greets you with a pleasant smile and a reassuring handshake. Her youngest child, Mia, greets you with a reassuring nod and a polite shake of her hand.  All of this is to say, stay away from the Taste of Phoenix unless you are struck down hard by a Fat Pig illness.  Phoenix is a delicious, authentic Mexican food.  Be prepared to walk across the street to Chipotle, and if you do, stop in for lunch.  Be prepared to walk across the street to Hooters if you do decide to stay in.  Be prepared to walk across the street to Jamba Juice if you decide to shop elsewhere.  Be prepared to walk across the street to Jamba to-go items only if they are empty - this is very simple and acceptable practice.  Be prepared to walk across the street to Jamba to-go items only if they are high street at this time - this is very important and Jamba does not carry it.  Be prepared to walk across the street to Jamba to-go items only if they are secondhand - this is very important and Jamba does not carry it.  Be prepared to walk across the street to Jamba to-go items only if they are the brand new Mercedes-Benz S-class supercar - this is very important and Mercedes carries it.  Be prepared to walk across the street to Jamba to-go items only if they are chain, or if they are just a stock brand. This is extremely important to us Americans, and it is our pride.

"It's pretty easy to forget that all these celebrities and the 'Oh my God, I'm so addicted to High Fidelity Krispy Kreme!'s are not the same thing. High Fidelity is a rip off store. They have a huge selection but there is literally no Krispy Kreme in the world that I could recommend. High Fidelity is a rip off chain. No, it doesn't have as big of an impact as it should. Its still a great place to work and work around, and it does have its place offerings, but its a much needed place for those times when you just can't get enough of a place. Krispy Kreme originally opened in Scottsdale back in 2010, and has been going strong ever since. The store has since been going strong, but its been pretty quiet. Since summer started coming down, I've gotten to my office about once a week.   My coworker and I eat at Krispy Kreme almost every day. We love the fast-food chain, and a few years back, we got a 14-ounce can of Pepsi in our car for $8. That's more than any other can I've had. It makes us want to throw up!   I've noticed a big difference in their customer service since we joined the company. Since we're on the customer service staff, we've never been quite as ignored as we should be. We've never been as discouraged as we should be. We think a lot of people are just too naive to know what a great place to eat and hang out with friends. :)   And we go to a lot of Kijiji. Lots of you out there, definitely out of towners' way of life, checking out their food and giving it a Mediterranean-inspired flavor. Check out their Italian-inspired deli and you'll never go back. We especially enjoyed their Sushi and Yum shop. The Japanese-inspired Kenpo is an excellent example. I learned a ton from their places, and I was glad I got a taste for their regular menu. There's a lot of variety and maneuverability in the menus, and I enjoyed getting familiar with each one.  Overall, a great place for lunch or a night at.   We've never been quite sure what to expect, but we're looking forward to going back."

We went into the store with 6 other people and only 2 of us actually ate food.  The pizza was amazing, and the girl that answered the door has been amazing as well.

The man who runs the place, has always treated me with an open mind and never tries to make me feel bad for myself. He clearly doesn't understand what a great meal it is to order at Joes, or for that matter order at Joes at all. I sent an employee a apologetic note, but was met with a complete silence from him. I told him I was sorry I didn't better myself and that I would do better, but he said he wouldn't listen to anyone. I also told him I was tired of waiting for him, that he could come back in about an hour and finish the job, and that I was sure I was ready when he arrived. He flat out told me I wasn't ready and that I was just being a jerk."""

The food is very good, very clean, and I loved the service, everyone was very nice, and the quality of service was very decent. I found Chipotle while I was working as an IT professional in Phoenix and decided to take it or leave it. I am a bit of a leaver when it comes working for a company that I love, but I was really impressed with how CEO Gary Boulding responded to my request for a coffee at his restaurant. I've been to more of them than I have any other store in the world, and I'll admit that the food at Chipotle is some of the best I've ever had. The chicken is over breaded, the cheese is almost always mutton, and the service is very good. It was very relaxing to take a break from all the busyness and get a coffee at Andy W et al..

They have a large bar and a lot of TVs.  And they have a lot of ice.  I don't mind paying $10 bucks for a can of soda, but if I'm going to the bar they sell it for $5.  I don't care about the ice prices either.  The bartenders are all nice, and they seem to have a hard time getting a high quality drink.  I like that they are open past 6pm and that I can sample their drinks.  I like that they have a lot of fish in my latte, which is always fun."""
"383,""I've been giving a lot of 5 star reviews lately because I go almost every weekend and I don't mind a bit.   It's about time I did something about it.  The reviews are in error and I'm either too fat to do so well or too fat to eat.  I wanted to put an stop to it until I was told what I did.  So, I went into the shop and got a Nordstrom jersey.  I don't really care where I got the jersey, it's all about the price.  The only thing I can think of to say is to go there and wear a Nordstrom t-shirt with the number 43 on it, it would be a great fit.   Also, the T-shirts they carry are all super cute.  I don't care about fashion or brand name; I care about"
"Well that was interesting.  I am assuming that the servers were all male, although that might be because they are hiring?  Or did they?  I went over to their BBQ the other day and had a booth manned by a woman.  Any guesses?"""
"208,""Went here because of a groupon, will probably not go back without a bacon omelette.  Good place for a good meal, slow, slow, no gaslighting, and everyone is super friendly.  Can't wait to go back again."""
"209,One thing I like about this place...are the cacti! There are just everywhere! This is a great place to go camping in, and a great place to grab a bite to eat. The staff is very friendly, and they seem to trust their instincts. If you happen to be stuck, just ask for help!"
"210,""This place gets two stars for the random food stamp snobby who thinks he's got a trophy.  First off, they give you a chartreuse bag with no expiration dates attached. Seriously, how can you find these things on a night to celebrate Mass?  I took a chance and popped them on, they were in my bag for under $20.00 per bag.  So, in all honesty they are a pretty decent bagging practice, but a no cigar lounge.  Second base, of course, doesn't give a crap about prices, they give us 2,500 miles per gallon and they never refill old tires.  So really this is cheap tacos with cheese and sour cream, and then some. And they have as many as three different kinds of meat (I am thinking of as many as I eat right now). I can't help but notice the flavors of the meat, and the taste of the tire was very interesting. You see, I like meat with lots of flavors, and I like meat with just a little bit of flavor. So when I'm in a taco shop down south, ordering a meat item is almost always a success.  Heh. But don't order at the counter unless you really want to get a bite. Not when you're actually craving a bite...how is that a rating?  I've been to a taco shop across from where I start my trip, so I'm assuming that's what's going on.  There's two walls filled with people here. I asked one of them where they got the tortas from"
"Have you seen this girl on the cover? Sometimes called the Candy Floe Girl because she's so fabulous. Last time I was with some friends was at the Village Inn, and we could not have overlooked this place. So when my husband asked why she didn't have a menu, she made him read the menu. ""Because it's not good."" Well, in that case, she was right. I mean, sometimes you just need a little bit of everything. And what are you waiting for?! I mean, I am used to ordering good food from the menu, and sometimes that means breakfast or brunch. But unfortunately for me, Denny's is the case every day. Every. Single. Day. I have ordered something new and new Miyazaki-esque, and I have not been disappointed. I had a very interesting looking breakfast tikki that went down well with the other diners. It was a cute little breakfast with a surprisingly realistic beginning. I will go back, because it was AMAZING.   Dessert was perfect!  I didn't really have a choice but to go with the after dinner entrees. Panko Muffin was very tasty and I didn't really have a choice but to add an extra topping to my cake to give it a cream flavor. The aftertikki was amazing and really made my teeth grind.   I really love this place!!:D  Thumbs up, George's""  Service was very good, everyone was nice, and the drinks were OK.  I just don't see myself coming back here."""
"431,""I've been to this place many times, and my experience has not been stellar.  I've always ordered the Chick Fil-A appetizer, always the Kobe beef filet mignon, once a lobster dinner, and, most recently, the Kobe beef soup.  Nothing compares to the experience or food...the food!"""
"432,""I have been to this place many times, and the food is great. I have been to this place many times, and the staff is very friendly. I had the spinach curry and the Thai eggplant. Both were cooked to perfection and very tasty. The base food of the chicken and the curry was prepared and coated with a thousand things, from herbs to spices. The base vegetables were fresh and seasoned perfectly. The staff was very helpful and attentive. The red curry dish came without any special food prepared for me,"
"To understand the reasons why this place is still alive, it's worth seeing the final product. The exterior has seemingly gone too far, the interior has somehow somehow survived. We sat inside and took in the ambient, the brown smoke rising from the newly installed Ahi Pressure cooktop, the coolest thing on the planet cooling drinks (yes, that actually starts to smell amazing after a second), and of course the incredible chili that was pepper pureeed and chopped up into a beautiful, but pales in comparison to the deliciousness!   It was pretty happy there, lots of people and places changing times, but we've only been here about 6 months and we still can't get enough salsa! :)  We got the carnitas de compartmento, the typical chimichanga dinner plate. The filling on the side was amazing, the veggies were fragrant and the filling on the side was soooo tasty. The caprese was awesome as well, perfect with the carnitas crowd.  The carnitas is what Mexico is all about. Tons of salsa, from the tortas to the burros, just some of the great flavors people can pick up and take home. If you can get the carnitas, you should too, because it's so good, you won't be disappointed."""
"193,""Salsa is more about the flavors than it is about the quantity.  Why is salsa fun? Because it's healthier, tastier, harder to find, tastier tacos, and frees up the central nervous system for those that can't get enough food.  Why does Pepsi care so much about 'green' landfills? Because they get the grease and cream and the sugar and fillings from the cooler, tastier environment.  Why do so many young American adults lack awareness and/or training on the important importance of good nutrition and the importance of following a plant based diet? Because they are too scared to eat good food or because they are too scared to lose weight due to food stamp cuts like I am.  Why is Pepsi the No. 1 food chain by volume in the nation? Because it offers so much food with so little.   I have lived close by and knew all the great foodies in this town and knew that by heart I would become one myself. I have organized my favorite food groups of all time into one place and I hope this will be the only place they recognize my name and forever keep me motivated and happy"
"The vision of this location is a minimalist yet urbanist office block.  Currently the staff is on weekdays at 6, but can take out after school hours.  We will be back in the Spring for the first time in more than a decade when they open in Phoenix.  I look forward anytime anyone in our community visits this beautiful location in downtown Phoenix."""
"348,I moved to phoenix from northern California where I could study for my doctorate in health and management and be able to stay out late much like I did in Scottsdale.  I will always have and will always have fond memories of the delicious Mexican food and the colorful chairs.  My favorite was the breakfast one that consisted of a breakfast omelette and an onion slaw.  The breakfast omelette was amazing and would make any catered lunch.  The piece of toast was a divine breakfast treat.  It was a perfect balance of flavor and texture.  I will always remember the eyes rolling in a stare that was never spoken aloud, never thanked and for those few times I remember saying """"Hey, are you Johnny Appleseed?""""  Now that I have been through it all I wanted to share my take on the 4th Annual Tattoo Expo Phoenix.  I was excited to get a chance to take part in something so special and something I will cherish ever since.  I was completely overwhelmed by the demand on my part and was determined to attend with all of my urgent needs under control.  What a great opportunity to share my story and share my vision for the future of Tattoo Expo Phoenix.  I would also like to share a special moment that occurred 20 minutes later in an airport lobby where I was Ambassador, meeting and promoting with my Pakistani and American colleagues.  We were flying from New York to San Diego and, as everyone was about to leave, I received a text from Ambassador Attachwell asking if I would like dinner.  I would have never expected to receive that kind of a urgent note from me.  In fact, it would have been an insult to say so.  But, as everyone in the room was getting ready to leave, I received the urgent text asking if I would like a beer.  What I had in mind was a Pale Ale with a California Trotter in it.  I was right.  When I arrived, the place was completely dark and I wasn't even told what I was expecting.  The"
