Timestamp,Score,"The hairdresser was nice, but she cut off a little too much hair than I would have liked. The shampoo smelled great though, so overall it was an okay experience. ",service was good. interior was nice. waitress named Beckie was extra friendly. overall best place for brunch in the valley,"""Hipster,Trendy"" ????-I think NOT !!!! Very disappointing......weird crowd ( older men on the prowl? ) , and unfriendly bartenders w/ lots of attitude. I've given this a few tries thinking I just hit it on a bad night , but won't be going back. So many other great places in Scottsdale to visit !","No complains here, the burgers were great!!","My husband & I have been going to one Zipp's or another around town for the last 7 years...we currently live near the Old Town location...always our 'go to' place to eat during the week when we don't feel like fixing dinner at home. It's your typical sports bar with a bit better food selection. You can't find a big 32oz beer for $4 ($3.50 @ happy hour) anywhere around town & their onion rings are outstanding, you can order 1/2 & 1/2 ...fries & onion rings with your burger or sandwich. We have never had an issue with the wait staff at any of the 3 different locations we have visited. The new boneless buffalo chicken skewers are fabulous & on special when regular wings are. Happy Hour M-F 3-7pm $5 Wings & other stuff Plus nightly specials 8pm-close & Weekend specials 11a-4p We love Zipp's!!",Perfect place for a hot summer day.  Amazing paletas!  Friendly staff and fresh ingredients.  Welcoming environment in downtown Chandler.,"I personally like this Fry's. I think most of the people that work there are extremely friendly. I go there once or twice a week and I'm always greeted with a smile. A few of them even ask me where I've been if I haven't been in for awhile and ask me how I'm doing. Complaing about a grocery store being crowded doesn't make sense to me since that means people like shopping there. They have no control of it being crowded. If you don't like it crowded, go across the street to Safeway where there is no one shopping there. Then you will see a difference of why Fry's is better. Why is it so busy? Because it has better deals and everyone wants to shop there. It's a positive thing. You can either deal with it being crowded once in awhile and save money or go to Safeway across the street where you will be the only shopper and get ripped off. You have options.",What did I just experience? I have never been more disrespected for in my life. The waitress messed up my order 5 times. I told her I was allergic to peanuts and lo and behold there was still a sprinkle of peanuts on top of the freaking noodles. If I ate that I would have sued them for basically trying to kill me. ,Wow! My nails have never looked this pretty like this place is a freaking hidden gem. I am definitely gonna bring my girlfriends here. Like the intricate designs are unmatched I have never ever seen another place do manicures like this,"Successfully blending the idea of bar food and airline food into one very disappointing meal. A poor choice for breakfast due to mealy/watery eggs, cold potatoes and bland salsa. Even the grapefruit juice lacked flavor."
