Timestamp,Score,"Did not have a great experience, location was super difficult to find and parking was really limited. Once I got inside, the wait time was over 45 minutes! The food was decent but definitely not worth the hassle. ","DO NOT EVER COME HERE!!!!! If you could give a health score below an F, I'd give it to this restaurant. The inside of the restaurant smelled so musty I could swear mold could be growing there. The service was okay, but the food was sh** The walnut shrimp had a grainy texture, and I'm scared I ate undercooked orange chicken. I swear I could make this at home with a frozen dinner because of how mediocre it was. And they even charged tip when I don't wanna give more of my money to this establishment. Pray that I don't get food poisoning.","Dim sum here is pretty alright. My girlfriend and I went here cause we saw a long line out the door, but the food tasted mediocre. Service was also alright, but since they are so busy, it's hard to get a waiter to come over","I signed up for Yelp just because of the poor service and being cheated out of money from Cafe Rio. I already voiced my complaint to the restaurant and to their website in writing, however I haven't received a phone call or email back.I've visited this establishment twice and each time I go I receive very little toppings on my burrito or tacos. I understand that it's made to your order like Chiptole or Qdoba, but they'll add very little cheese or toppings on your food, which can cause you to request more. To save myself time and every yelpers eyes from reading this long story, the individual making my tacos was extremely frugal on the toppings on my tacos. She barely put any cheese on my 3 tacos and I simply requested that she could put a little more on the tacos. She did and when I went to pay for my order, I was charged an extra 95 cents for ""side cheese."" The issue isn't the money because eating at Cafe Rio can be expensive for a fast-food mexican restauant, but it's the principle of charging me extra after I said, ""can you please put a little more cheese on my taco."" This hasn't been the first time this happened, but a previous visit had the same result with the sauce on my burrito. I thought mexican food restaurants had gigantic burritos and generous size tacos, but Cafe Rio will charge you on top of your order if you don't like their skinny tacos.All I ask for from Cafe Rio to acknowledge that when you add more toppings to what the cook's add to your food, that they say, ""this will be extra."" They do this at Chiptole and Qdoba, but Cafe Rio would rather screw you over at the end. I will not be visiting this establishment again. As I said, it's the principle as to why they charged me extra for this, not the money.","Wound up at Rock Bottom by chance had been wanting Carrabbas all day, due to being brain washed by commercials on TV so that when a friend said lets go out for dinner I was all gun ho to say Carrabbas, then he said Im in the mood for steak I tossed the pasta idea out the window and said Bring on the beef,  plus never been to Rock Bottom so I was thrilled at being able to try a new place! It was a Sunday night and the place was simi empty, which was nice. Service was fast and friendly and I liked the overall vibe of the place. I ordered the Texas Fire Steak which was top sirloin seasoned with crazy peper and smoking jalapeno butter, man it was delish!! Even the veggies were good!  Looking forward to another trip there to try out some more the menu!","I love guerrero's!  I worked in Mesa 15 years ago and we did burrito runs here all the time. I'm a huera, but my Hispanic pals all rated this place authentic.  It's a husband and wife team that runs it.  The best thing are the beans - incidentally, that's how I rate the authenticity of Mexican fare- They are the kind of beans I ate in Nogales during college (at a place I could only locate while intoxicated).  Thinner, lighter colored, and delicious compared to any I've EVER had this side of the border.  I live in PV now- super far - but after this I think I'm gonna have to take a road trip tomorrow to Mesa! Yum!","Yay I am a fan...ok for the ladies...this is a tough bit, I have shopped here with girls who literally will hide good finds in other places of the store so they can come back and get them later, most of the time they are gone. Funny huh, this place literally looks worse then some of the barrio shops in rocky point, it seems like it is the day after thanksgiving every day there, and people literally throw stuff anywhere.For the guys this place is a pretty good place to go, the deals on shoes are unreal, nikes that are $100.00 bucks for like $20.00, you can't get that anywhere. You can also get top notch clothing and make you look like a true Scottsdale deuschbag for less then 100 bucks Rolex or Tag Heur watches will not be found here, sorry deuschbaggery only goes so far at last chance. In any event this is probably one of the best bargain basement places in the valley to get top notch stuff.  Two things you need to know about this place.1. They restock every Sunday, so Sunday mornings here really are like every black Friday after thanksgiving, you might get trampled to death like that guy at Walmart or shot like those two dudes at Toy's R Us..and it could be your last chance:)2. Check all your shit seriously, allot of this stuff is here because it is damaged, so be careful they have no return policy that is why it is LAST CHANCE!","Bar was pretty chill. Went here for my gal's birthday, and I gotta say I really recommend their cocktails. We weren't expecting anything superb but it was really worth the price. Even made something special for my gf's birthday","I've brought my dogs here and met with both Dr. Holmes and Dr. Edwards and they were both extremely knowledgeable and helpful. Over the last 15 years of living in Phoenix we brought all 6 dogs that we have had in that time to come see them and I wouldn't go anywhere else. This past summer I moved to Boston and regrettably haven't found a quality veterinary hospital like Pecan Grove. Ashamedly, even after talking to my current vet and be unsatisfied with their answers, we called Pecan Grove and Dr. Holmes was very helpful and was even able to reference cases and articles to us over the phone. While the answer we got from our Boston vet sounded more like they were guessing than actually knowing the answer.Pecan Grove and everyone there is amazing and I wouldn't go anywhere else (had I not moved across the country)","The new Harkins Cine Capri, one of the first things to open in Tempe Marketplace, boasts 16 theatres and offers more than the norm when it comes to movie snacks. Moviegoers can order brownie bites, mozzarella sticks and pizza.The theatre is super spacious and the seats are plush and comfy. And the screen is huge. This is my new favorite movie theatre.","Let the attack of the Blue Hairs begin!  You simply cannot eat here without being shoulder checked by retiree's from Sun City West & Sun City Grand.  They must get to the scrambled eggs before you do, because YOU may take all of them.  The food - yeah, it's basically OK for a buffet.  The selection is pretty good, the food is hot, and some of it is even tasty.  The tables are jammed in to make more room for the elderly and to maximize profits.  And it is your typical buffet decor.  Did I mention that the old farts are like professional hockey players when they get near a buffet?  It is like in a room full of food suddenly becoming afraid that you won't get what you want to eat.  It is ABSURD!Go if you must, but bring some attitude and some shoulder pads.  Watch out for old farts.  Wear an Obama shirt, that should really get em pissed at ya.",Awesome place. Staff is very helpfull!,"I am so loyal to Durant's that I feel like a heel...but City Hall was divine.  Steaks, sides, drinks...the only thing we didn't have was dessert...but $1100 later, who could afford it?","So, for my date tonight to the Compass Room, I needed to get my nails done.  I removed my acrylics myself last week.  I read the reviews here and decided to try DV.You know, sometimes when you walk into a nail shop for the first time, it's almost like the Soup Nazi.  Not this place!There were two girls ahead of me, so I waited a bit, but only about ten minutes.  It's bigger than the place I had been going to!  Really clean and I heard ENGLISH being spoken by the nail techs!  That was nice.  Yeah, there were still speaking Vietnamese (or so I think) to each other, yes, probably about us gringas, but it was refreshing to hear actualy conversations.I had Le.  She was so sweet!  I told her all about my date, too.She was quick, and made some suggestions about what to get.  Usually I like clear tips that they have to paint.  I was kinda short on time, so I went with her suggestion of white tips.  Plus, it was about $5 cheaper.She was quick but *really* methodical.  I think this may be the nicest set of acrylics I've gotten out here in the PHX!She even called me by name throughout the conversation.$25 for a new full set.  Not bad at all",My mom surprised me for trip to a spa here for my birthday and I was so amazed!!! I felt completely relaxed and my spa technician is so great,"I am slightly confused as to what this place is.Is it a coffee shop? yes.Is it an ice cream parlor? well..yes.Is it an antechamber for the hair salon upstairs? kinda.Seemingly the Pink Spot *giggle* is trying to be a few things at once, and vaguely succeeding at those goals.I like the Pink Spot *giggle* for a number of reasons:-location-convenience-ambience-selectionIn all honestly it isnt the best coffee shop that the area offers, but It's another option- and that my friends, is a corner stone of capitalism: consumer choice.Now I won't be making the Pink Spot *giggle*, my local haunt, that spot belongs to Lola, and I would never cheat on my beloved tranny. But for those special nights when I get the strange urge for simultaneous brain freeze and a scalded tongue, i'll go down on the Pink Spot...*giggle*",Ask for Henry! He will fix up your car so fast its amazing,"Should be called house of deliciousness!I could go on and on about this item, that item, blah blah blah but I dont really waznt to. This is good food, done creatively, and in my mind presented in a casual yet sophisticated manner without any pretensiousness. The chef here creates inspirational dishes that seem to meld asian and southwestern flavors seemlessly. Ok so now I realize this are not all real words but after eating here and developing a drunken state of mind who really cares anyhow?The lowdown is the food is good and priced fair for what you get. Our service was great and on top of everything we truly had an amazing time on a rainy Saturday evening. Next time hopefully we can enjoy the killer outdoor bar and patio seating.I cant wait to go back and eat our way through the new menu.The custom cocktails were delightful and the wine list is pretty spot on.","A bit pricey, yet one of the best breakfast sandwiches you will find.  Parking is slim.","This is probably the sweet I crave the most! Salted Butter Caramel! Yummmm! When I cant make it up to Scottsdale, I stop by my local Whole Foods in Chandler and pick up a pint from the freezer section and it is just as good.",i la la loveee this place! literally time flies by when i bleach my hair because like andy and patrick gossip time makes up for just sitting there waiting while my scalp low-key BURNS,Honestly I do not understand the hype. Not worth the overpriced ice cream. Just go buy some Dreyers at Vons,"Meh..not particularly memorable.I've eaten at this location and the one by ASU, though I like this location better. I would probably only eat here if I was walking by and I was starving. The cookies ROCK though, I like that you get one with your sandwich. And they have my favorite flavor of Jones Soda (Sugar-free Black Cherry) which kicked ass. Warning: The roast beef sandwich (Overture?) comes with horseradish sauce and it is hot as a mother.  I like the spice but it was almost unbearable. My nose pretty much turned into a snotty waterfall. Go to Opa Grill next door instead.","As you may have read in a previous review, so graciously provided by Dally, that Four Peaks is our post-Tuesday night hockey watering hole. We normally show up stinky and limping or in some sour mood or another. Somehow we always leave a little happier, but still limping, well I do anyway. Unfailingly, we are greeted by the bouncer, who no longer cares to see our ID's, either because he can see the age in our strides or because he knows us now. I would like to believe the latter. Also, waiting for us is the lovely and nicht so talented Karina. Bless her poor soul for putting up with our asinine questions about her life and our requests for more water. She humors us anyway. We are made to feel like this place is home, at least for a couple of hours on a Tuesday night. Karina knows what we order for drinks and never has to ask, just brings. I usually switch between a simple salad with a great balsamic vinaigrette or a plate of fries. I know, diametrically opposed. Just depends on the mood and how committed I am that day/week to my diet. I always get the 8th St Ale though. It is very good and for 3 bucks can't be beat. I have enjoyed the pretzels, the now ""famous"" nachos, with chicken mind you, the spinach-artichoke dip, some of the various wing flavors, and a pizza. For late night dining they are all very palatable.  I have a funny wing story, but I think it is only funny to me, Dallas, Z, and our friend Peter.  If we ever get the elusive Z to join, I will make sure he shares his story on here.Until then, check out Four Peaks in Scottsdale.  The late night menu satisfies and is not hard on the wallet.  Tell Karina Brad sent you.  You won't get a discount, maybe just a laugh.","This gym is great...  I joined because it opened only about 3 minutes away from my house.  I keep going back because every person who works there is so nice and greets you with a smile and a friendly hello.  It is not intimidating at all, which is a big step up from the LA Fitness that I used to go to.  The staff gets to know you by name and most of the other members are quite friendly as well.   The gym is open enough that you can do free weights on your own without bumping into anyone and there are always plenty of cardio machines available.   I've been going there for over a year and plan to continue doing so!"
