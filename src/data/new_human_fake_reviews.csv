"The caesar salad was underwhelming to say the least, the lettuce was limp and the dressing was way too heavy. Would not recommend. "
"Staff was great! Super friendly, got us seated almost right away, and gave excellent recommendations from the menu. "
"I tried this place because a friend said it was better than our local taco truck, and was not disappointed. Their birria was phenomenal, and the portions were so great for the price! Am definitely going back. "
"Did not have a great experience, location was super difficult to find and parking was really limited. Once I got inside, the wait time was over 45 minutes! The food was decent but definitely not worth the hassle. "
"Hands down the best sushi I've had in the city during the past 7 years I've lived here. Everything was so fresh and you could tell they were crafted with care. Their ocha was also super rich, a huge bonus! "
Stopped by this place on the way home from work and got takeout. Food was good quality and run by a sweet elderly couple. Would recommend for food or even just good conversation - support your local businesses! 
"Got really bad food poisoning after trying the ceviche here the other day, but would still recommend their other entrees. "
"I ordered a grain bowl and received a bowl with only greens and a note that said ""Sorry, we ran out of grains"". Would have appreciated the notice earlier and ordered something else. "
"The short rib gnocchi is a must try, the meat is so soft it just falls off the bone and goes super well with a nice red wine. "
This was my third time having to contact the restauarant because they got my order wrong. The place wasn't even super busy so I'm not sure why it happens so often. Love the food but the service is subpar. 
"No complains here, the burgers were great!!"
Terrible service! I had to wait 30min until my order was taken and then even after my plates were cleared I waited for nearly an hour to get my bill. WILL NOT COME BACK
"I was really nervous trying a new hairstyle, but Greg was amazing. He gave me a haircut that made me feel a sense of confidence that I had lost for 10 years. He made me feel safe to try new things and I will definitely be back on the regular."
Car came back with more dirt than when I left it! I paid for a car wash not for it to look like I just took trip on dirt roads. Unbelievable. 
Wow! My nails have never looked this pretty like this place is a freaking hidden gem. I am definitely gonna bring my girlfriends here. Like the intricate designs are unmatched I have never ever seen another place do manicures like this
I found the rarest books here!! The store owner is the cutest elderly lady who is so knowledgable she also has the most adorable precocious grandaughter who were so helpful when I was searching for books to help write my thesis. Support local shops and check them out
Honestly I do not understand the hype. Not worth the overpriced ice cream. Just go buy some Dreyers at Vons
"The hairdresser was nice, but she cut off a little too much hair than I would have liked. The shampoo smelled great though, so overall it was an okay experience. "
I spilled some water all over my cellphone and my friend reccommended this shop to me. I was a little scared when I saw how tiny the shop looked. I explained how I would need my phone ASAP and the dude was super chill he told he that he would get it back to me in 2 days. He priority shipped some materials for me at no extra cost just asked me to leave a review of the service. Phone is working as good as new and I will also refer my other friends over here for any tech hardware issues. 
What did I just experience? I have never been more disrespected for in my life. The waitress messed up my order 5 times. I told her I was allergic to peanuts and lo and behold there was still a sprinkle of peanuts on top of the freaking noodles. If I ate that I would have sued them for basically trying to kill me. 
"Wanted to try this place out because it was new and poppin, but they had the worse service possible.. Had to wait an hour for my food and couldnt ever get a waiter to come over to take my order or get extra utensils"
service was good. interior was nice. waitress named Beckie was extra friendly. overall best place for brunch in the valley
Dylan's a great guy! Called the plumbing service and they sent them over in a jiffy we had some leaks in our kitchen faucet. wouldnt completely turn off so we weren't sure what to do. dylan came over and immediately new what the probelm was. even gave me a coupon if we ever need his serrvice again
"So like my best friend and I wanted to try this place after seeing it on Instagram, and we were totally impressed. Tiffany was my hair stylist, and she's been at the salon for years. Totally knows what she's doing. I'm so in love with my new hair color, and even while I was sitting around dyeing my hair, she brought out beverages, we talked about life, it was such a great time. Definitely a 5 star rating"
"DO NOT EVER COME HERE!!!!! If you could give a health score below an F, I'd give it to this restaurant. The inside of the restaurant smelled so musty I could swear mold could be growing there. The service was okay, but the food was sh** The walnut shrimp had a grainy texture, and I'm scared I ate undercooked orange chicken. I swear I could make this at home with a frozen dinner because of how mediocre it was. And they even charged tip when I don't wanna give more of my money to this establishment. Pray that I don't get food poisoning."
"Bar was pretty chill. Went here for my gal's birthday, and I gotta say I really recommend their cocktails. We weren't expecting anything superb but it was really worth the price. Even made something special for my gf's birthday"
"My husband's car got keyed so we needed a nice but affordable paint job. We saw the reviews for this place and they all seemed good. It was just what we needed, but we do wish they were a little faster since it wasn't a major job. Not bad though"
Tacos were okay. Meat was a little over cooked and a little sparse. Tortilla was great and they have a wide selection of salsas to choose from. Every order also comes with chips. Also has a Taco Tuesday deal. Not amazing but coul dbe a good bang for your buck.
"My hair was ruined!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! *sob* I came her to try out something new, and the reviews looked great. I showed my stylist a picture and they seemed nice and all. And I was really hoping I could show off my new do with school starting again but no. Like you think with a picture they'd know what to do, but I guess not everyone with a stylist certification can actually do their job right. 0/5 stars if possible smh"
Worst japanese food ive ever eaten. I went here with my family tonight and my sons ordered their teriyaki bentos. My wife and I shared their shoyu ramen but wow what a disappointment. Just looking at the rice I wonder how someone can mess that up so badly. Meanwhile our noodles were soggy. Complete disaster!
"Dim sum here is pretty alright. My girlfriend and I went here cause we saw a long line out the door, but the food tasted mediocre. Service was also alright, but since they are so busy, it's hard to get a waiter to come over"
My mom surprised me for trip to a spa here for my birthday and I was so amazed!!! I felt completely relaxed and my spa technician is so great
i la la loveee this place! literally time flies by when i bleach my hair because like andy and patrick gossip time makes up for just sitting there waiting while my scalp low-key BURNS
gnochi here are so marvelous. My tastebuds were on fire with how good the pasta dish was
"ummm what? i honestly came into this place because it smelled so freakin good but then the food..it did not match the amazing scents at all! it was so bland, such a shame"
sooo prettyyy! the aesthetics are top tier! its like THE place to go for taking cute insta pics but the coffee is just alright
"I entered the shop at around 1:30PM and browsed for the most appropriate art piece for my living room for approximately 23 minutes. The salesmen kept pestering me about if I had made a decsion yet, but I needed my time to truly capture the essence of the piece. Finally I found THE one and the kind woman working at the front was very professional about the care that would be taken in transporting the piece. So I suppose besides the initial annoyance, everything seemed pretty smooth."
Ask for Henry! He will fix up your car so fast its amazing
Took my car here for an oil change and somehow I ended up with a flat?! What type of fool was doing my car?? I told the manager about it and he didn't even show any remorse or apologize AT ALL. JEEZ I hope this place goes out of business
