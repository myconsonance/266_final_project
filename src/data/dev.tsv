5058	1	a	I'm a supporter of this store. At present, it leaves something to be desired, but we're starved for a place to shop on this side of town that has local and/or natural foods, so something is better than nothing! Also, I have faith that they will expand the available goods as time goes on. I'm excited to see how it develops.  The good:  Great bread! This is the best part of this place thus far. The breads are fresh daily, baked locally, CHEAP ($1.79 per loaf for white, wheat, rye, marble ryle, onion, etc...), and all natural. And most importantly, they taste really good.  Picking up a loaf of the onion rye has already become a weekly ritual for me. They also have specialty pastries, tortillas, etc. Though I haven't tried those yet, they look good, and the prices are also very reasonable.  The produce is also good. It's not a huge selection, but the prices are fair and the quality seems good. It's great to have locally grown items available nearby.  Everyone who works there is super friendly, which is great, and they seem to be open long hours, which is really convenient.  The down-side: As I said, very limited selection. The dry goods vary between local (mostly) and mass-produced (some random items). Some of the local artisan products look great, but they're very expensive. I think they'd be a little cheaper at an actual farmers' market (ie, where we're buying direct from the producer)--but I do plan to save up so I can try the pasta, etc.  Weirdly, this place rounds out its selection of local/natural stuff with mass-produced crappy candy, ice cream bars, toilet paper, etc. I can't help but wish they'd found some greener alternatives. (Also-- Fiji Water? Come on, guys... That company is TERRIBLE. And the opposite of local. I don't get why they carry it.)  SUMMARY: Overall, a great effort that I think will get better. In the meantime, get over there for your bread and veggies, stat.
445	1	a	"I'll agree that this is a great meet up place in the city. Nice neighborhood, adequate parking in the structure behind, and a greta atmosphere with great service. The menu is interesting and I'd come back to try more but here's what our first visit was like.  As a Starter we had the Spinach Quesadilla made with Lavosh and it was great. I mean really great and enough as a meal for two. For that alone I'd go back.  My better half had the Falafel Pita and thought it was OK.  I had the Gyros Pita and got luncheon meat. I'm talking precisely sliced, straight from the fridge but thrown on the grill to warm-up luncheon meat. If you go online to see the menu, it's one of the items you can click for a nutrition chart. Here's what it reads for the ""meat"" Gyro Beef [Beef, Lamb, Water, Bread Crumbs (Bleached Wheat Flour, Water, Dextrose,Salt and Yeast may contain soy bean oil, Calcium Propionate), Soy Protein Concentrate, Less thean 2% Salt, Garlic and Onion Powder, Monosodium Glutamate, ];  So, the takeaway here is stay away from the Gyro.   But, Hey!  Gyro IS a pita. I expected a reasonable execution. Heck, make a Gyro meatloaf and slice it up at least.   Yes, I'm bitter."
8830	0	a	The parking is my beef with this place.  Why does a customer have to pay $12 for each time we park at the garage?  If you move in and out three times, that's $36 for parking.  Yes, my company was paying, but this was just outright stupid and I wouldn't make my company pay for this again. I've been to Phoenix twice since then, and I've avoided this place and stayed at the Marriot.  Much better place.
477	1	a	Alright, went back last night, felt bad because we were the late nighters, and everything was perfect.  The pizza, the salads and the wine were all so well done.  And what finally brought me to five stars was the crepe with Nuteila and Mascarpone.  OMG amazing.  I'm currently craving it the day after.  Totally beats out the crepe with nutella and banana that I also love...
1514	1	a	"Uh-oh. Where am I?   The view from atop the mountain is superb. The city can be seen in all directions. Look, there's Downtown 1 and Downtown 2. And a bunch of houses under construction. And look at that sky. Wowza.   Ok, so stopping to enjoy the view is one thing. Stopping to figure out where the hell you are is another. ""Don't worry,"" I told my friend. ""This city is laid out in a grid. If anything, we can walk down the other side of the mountain and cut back across on the street."" Oh, little did I know.   Let me give you the back story. I've been to South Mountain twice. The first time was Christmas Eve 2006 when hardly a soul could be found. I met a friend there and we blazed our own trail. He always had his jeep in sight, so no harm in getting turned around. I trusted him to be my guide.   The second and last time I hiked South Mountain was in February. My best friend flew in to Phoenix for the weekend (for my birthday) and since the weather was so great (in comparison to Detroit), she wanted to be out in the sun as much as possible. No problem. I knew where we could go for a good hike. Little did I know we'd get lost.   We parked at the 24th St. entrance and picked our path, the Mormon Trail. We were on our way to discovering religion, we joked, passing by several other hikers. When we reached a recognizable summit, we stopped to appreciate the view... and then ponder our location. Should we turn around and go back the way we came? Were we still on the Mormon Trail? Where were the markers, the loops, the signs from God? We looked at each other, each of us having a take-no-prisoners personality when it comes to conquering great piles of rock. ""Onward!"" we shouted, punching the air with our fists.   A little while later, we were once again stopped, our eye squinting against the retiring sun. I wouldn't call us ""lost,"" as this point in time, but that's only because I'm too stubborn to admit such an error. ""Let's ask somebody,"" I suggested. So, the next hiker dude that passed by, we stopped to ask him, ""Will this trail loop back around?"" ""Where do you want to go?"" he asked. That's when I realized we had tied our tennis shoes tight only to march into a rocky labyrinth. I told him where we parked and he said it was a good 2 hour hike back to our car, yet about another mile or two to the 48th St. entrance. Oh, no problem, I thought, since the city was laid out like a grid. Little did I know there are exceptions to that.   We pressed on, thanking our impromptu guide friend. We hiked and hiked and hiked, passing by fellow hikers and mountain bikers. Finally, the trail opened up to flat land. We were close, or so we thought. When we reached the end of the trail, there was no parking lot and no street connecting us to where we needed to go. Instead, there was a long gravel road that weaved itself through a golf course. W.T.F.  We set out to walk the long gravel road until we hit Baseline, in which we were determined to cut back Westward and find my car, the only way we had of getting anywhere. The sun was setting. We had no time to waste.   Having hiked about 15 miles already, our feet were heavy, like cinder blocks. But, we continued on. ""Let's hitch a ride,"" I suggested. People were gathering in their wonderful Ford pick-up trucks and jeeps. Hikers are friendly, I thought; somebody was bound to accept our plea for help. We opted to just do this ourselves.   That's when a car slowed down. ""Ugh, creep,"" I thought. Instead, it was our helpful hiker friend from the summit. He asked if we needed a ride. My best friend and I exchanged glances. I thought, ""We can take him."" After a 70-second long pause, we accepted. She hopped in back and I rode shot gun, leaving my seat-belt off and the door unlocked, in case of a speedy getaway.   We chit chatted on the drive down the road, which lead to another road, and then another and another, until we finally touched Baseline. Where the hell were we? That's when it hit us. We would have been walking another 7 miles on foot back to my car. All these windy, disjointed roads. Damn golf course. Damn South Mountain. Damn unmarked trails. It should change its name to the Moron Trail, for we just blazed it enthusiastically.   The kind hiker man dropped us off at my car and drove away. With a sigh large enough to blanket the skyline, we unlocked my car, got inside and drove away - away from South Mountain, nature's beast and practical joker.   We counted the miles and the minutes it would have taken us to get back to my car. Another hour, at least. The sun would have set by then and we would have missed our dinner engagement. Lucky for us, we stopped the right hiker friend at the right moment; otherwise, I may never have made it home to write this review."
4695	1	a	I had the pleasure of going to the grand opening of Total wine and more!  They had penny wine tasting, they card you at the door and you put your penny into the hurricane jug.  The place is Disneyland for adults, they have every imaginable wine, liquor, or beer that you would be searching for.  Since I recently went to Sonoma, California in August, I was looking for a few of my fave wines that I liked, but they did not have some of the smaller wineries and plus they are limited releases.  I did find one from Ferrari-Carano, Fum√© Blanc,  for $10.97. Ferrari told me that you can find some of their wines in a grocery stores, but not the Fume Blanc, so they lied.  I also purchased a Kokopelli Cab for $13.99 and Kokopelli is local to Arizona  made in Wilcox.   This place has excellent deals and glad to see this kind of store in San Tan Village Mall.
2845	1	a	i visited on jan 19 and ordered the thai basil (their signature dish) with calamari, which had a very unique flavor that was a bit masked by the spiciness. i'm a wimp when it comes to spices, and i was overwhelmed by the medium i ordered. though the dish was very good, it was, for a dish dish consisting mostly of vegetables, on the scant side for 11.95.   my friend ordered a curry, and it was a sizable portion, presented in a clay pot. i sneaked a bite, and it was very good too.  the place is comfortable and intimate, with booths and tables, and the wait staff is very friendly.
4921	1	a	Costco Travel - My husband and I recently returned from a trip to the Big Island, HI that we arranged throught Costco Travel. After shopping around I found that their prices were the best and after one phone call I was able to make all arrangements for airfair, condo and car. They didn't have arrangements with any B&Bs on Hilo but were able to adjust our travel dates. Everything went according to plan with all arrangements being accurate. Condo was outstanding and a great value. We got gas and did some souvenier shopping at the Costco in Kona and again saved $$.   I've shopped at Costco for years - now becoming a groupie!
8095	0	a	Personally, I used to come here a lot more often than I do.  I've noticed, what I feel to be, a rather slide in the quality in the food.  The carne asada burrito I recently got tasted okay, but the meat tasted lesser quality than I was used to.  The guacamole was a bit thinner than i like.  I gave them this score due to them having much better history with me and I hope/think/suspect  they had a weak day.  If they do better or worse next time, I'll post something that will reflect it.
7943	1	a	The very definition of an average brunch.  My omelet was pretty decent, and it's nice that they let you choose a bunch of ingredients if you want to.  However the breakfast potatoes are extremely weak, fairly bland and underseasoned and are probably not hand cut and prepared.  They are mixed with an uninspiring blend of green peppers.   The rest of my table seemed to feel about as enthusiastic as I did about their breakfast burritos.  The service was also pretty slow.  Despite the awesome patio and pretty good eye candy among the patronage here, this place is definitely one you can skip.
9065	1	a	"I guess it's not really the most accessible place, but Frank & Albert's is located in the Arizona Biltmore Resort & Spa and serves as one of their restaurants to their guests.  Since the other breakfast place they had was only a cafe that served baked goods, I decided to come here to have a proper breakfast.  When I asked what they recommended they immediately said ""the Biltmore Benedict"".  I was easily sold so I ordered one, and a coffee.  Cool thing about the coffee is they just bring you a carafe to serve yourself coffee as you please.  Not sure if this was because the waitress was lazy, but I thought it was nice.  The eggs benedict themselves were not the best.  On one hand the ham that they used was overcooked (ie. jerky).  On the other hand the english muffin was over toasted and too crispy, which kinda ruined the overall consistency.  It is a nice patio that they have to sit on, so I will give them that.  They apparently have a bird problem where birds kinda come and scavenge for food.  I didn't really mind it."
2947	1	a	"It's called ""Babeway"" for a reason people...   But I go here for the Deli, they have the best panini. I like to stop in for the 3 cheese panini with mustard and tomato. It's also a good choice to pair up with the Italian wedding soup."
6162	1	a	Took the family to the recent opening of this local Logan's Roadhouse to check it out and maybe find a new local 'gem'.  Initial impressions were that Logan's is an imitation of one of my favorite family steakhouses, Texas Roadhouse. We go there every chance we can and have never been disappointed in the quality of food or service.  Anyway back to Logan's, atmosphere was 'okay' (again a wannabe Texas Roadhouse but not quite right), service was fine, but once the food came, that 'sealed the deal' - very disappointing. Not that it was bad or anything, but the quality of the steaks just wasn't anywhere close to what you get at Texas Roadhouse, and when the prices are about the same, well, there's just no sense wasting time or money here. You might think I'm being rough but when all 3 of my kids (ages 7-11) say that they like Texas better, that's gotta say something (they usually never say anything bad - they usually just eat whats in front of them!) So by now you can obviously guess that I don't recommend Logan's.  I really only have one more thing to add.... .....Don't mess with Texas.....
8265	1	a	THIS PLACE IS GREAT IF YOU ARE TRAVELING WITH YOUR DOG!  The double bed room was extremely clean and updated. Nice fluffy pillows and duvet covers. Bathrooms nice and new looking. The daily breakfast bar was wonderful and the sitting area clean and nice.   The one issue was the AC. Jeez it was a rattle bucket and kept us up at night. we would turn it off until we would wake up sweating and then turn it on for an hour, wake up and turn it off.....oh brother.  I would have liked a good night sleep, since everything else was nice.   Pets welcome and that was a bonus.
3458	1	a	This place was the answer to my German grocery shopping dreams! I thank the Yelp community for leading me to Old Heidelberg. I was picking up a number of items for an Oktoberfest party I was cooking for and hosting at my house, and was able to fulfill most of my exotic German needs at this one stop. I picked up pumpernickel rye bread, authentic concentrated Maggi W√ºrze seasoning (not the soy sauce-tasting stuff you find in most American grocery stores) and Knorr zwiebel-kr√§uter salat kr√∂nung. They also had lots of Knorr sauce mixes that you just can't find over here (for instance,  sauerbraten gravy).  I stuck around for a few minutes to talk to the two women who ran the place (Andrea and Chris). I volunteered that I had lived in Germany for years, including Berlin and Bavaria.  They were totally friendly and even suggested some other places nearby that I could check out for German grub or rarer German beer selections. I promised I would be back... especially since I spotted that they had frozen leberkn√∂del (liver dumplings). I made these once from scratch years ago but that was a lot of work. Knowing that they carry such delicacies has snagged me hook, line and sinker, as I am now destined to return and once again indulge my German food fantasies.
5244	1	a	Why do you bring in the best bands and then torture me?  Parking is freaking ridiculous, at least I have been enough times to know to leave my car on Mill and walk. Your security people are a bunch of freaking jerks who take their power wayyyy to seriously - take off my shoes? What kind of weapon or drugs can I be hiding in my open toed 2 inch heels? Your sound SUCKS - seriously sucks. For all the fees you charge on top of tickets - buy some new speakers already. The bathrooms are gross Drinks are reasonable so you get 2 stars  (Watch out for the glass walls leading to the patio if you have overindulged in booze.. I've heard they are easy to run in to).
9802	1	a	I've always wanted a family friendly jeweler.  Esp. if my at the time boyfriend was going to buy me an engagement ring.  It means so much to me to have the true customer service when buying fine Jewelry, someone I can trust.  And when I found this place one day while I was at CVS I knew I had found a Gem (pun intended)! Peggy really made me and my now finance feel like we were family.  She helped him pick out my fabulous ring and answer every single one of his questions.  I'm so proud to tell everyone where we got the ring from because I think everyone should know about this place!  If your looking for great jewelry with a warm smile, head on over.  They are so excited to help you!
3369	0	a	We went here once a week for the year my husband was in grad school.   The food is a 4, but the waitresses are a 5.   It was a half mile from our apartment and so we would walk there and walk back to work off the huge portions.    This is the only restaurant in my life where I could consider myself a regular.   We never really talked with the waitresses or knew their names, but they always knew what I wanted; I didn't have to order.  They always gave me water with no ice no lemon, my husband's with ice and lemon, gave me my panang curry with chicken medium and waited for my husband to choose what he wanted. He probably ordered most of the items on the menu.  They refilled my rice if I ran out without asking.  Our bill always came to $19.53 for dinner more times than I can remember.  We went maybe twice for lunch, but almost always for dinner.  My husband graduated last month and we moved from Tempe but we miss this place dearly.
8693	1	a	I'm always perplexed when the staff knows nothing about their on-line specials. This time it was the Yelp ad. Luckily it was quickly resolved by the bartender this time which was refreshing.   The place it's self is a pretty generic bar. I just had a few drinks along with the Crab Cakes which were actually pretty good.
3110	1	a	I finally tried Spicy Pickle last week. I like the name and was intrigued about their menu. Paninis, soups, salads, pizzetas, nothing out of the ordinary. I had a half sandwich ( Sausalito Bandido?), half salad combo ( Spinach salad). Food was fresh and good. The sandwich could have stand a little more meat, it was truly flat. The salad was crisp and dressing was on the side, which I appreciated.   On my way out I got a chocolate chip cookie that was OK. I love cookies and they have to be pretty bad for me not to like them. This one, I kid you not, must have had maybe 3-4 chocolate chips? So if you're craving chocolate, this is not the cookie for you.
6155	1	a	"Second to worst dining experience of all time.  Our waitress was a little timid, which is fine, but it we shouldn't have to wait 20 minutes just to order our food.  Our food took 45+ minutes to arrive, and while our friend's steak came out hot, our Hibachi Steak and Potatoes were room temperature.  Sent it back to be warmed, they offered to pay for it, which is great.  Both managers came and said hi and apologized for the slow cook staff, and made sure everything was great.   That was the last we saw of them for the next half hour.  We finished our meals, and 10 minutes later, had to flag down a different waitress to go and find our waiter, and to bring us cheesecake menus.  We always get the Dulce de Leche, but they brought us terrimisu or some junk.  I gave it back to the waiter (after walking the restaurant to hunt him down) and said ""no thanks, I'll just pass on the cheesecake.""  He looked surprised, and later said we didn't have to pay for that cheesecake.  Well I'd sure hope not!  Two hours of my life are gone.  I usually like this restaurant, but tonight's service disaster will prevent me from EVER going to this location again, free food or not."
5043	1	a	Love it! The food is VERY spicy though.  Luckily, I have burned off all of my taste buds so far from all my mexican food endeavors, however, the wussies out there should take note :)  Just realize that this place is VERY small and can get VERY crowded.  I was there once and George W Bush came in to eat there.  Evidently he loves the food.
8240	1	a	This store is a average. It has a six month wall. This place does not bag and board new issues unless asked. The store specializes in new stuff only and has almost no back stock. The store has tournaments for card gaming on weekends. The staff doesn't talk to new customers much or ask them if they need assistance. Note for true comic fans... This store is good for new comics on Wednesdays and supplies but that is about it. Dime-a-dozen store... nothing special.
463	1	a	One of my regular buffet stops. great service and average food.
8769	1	a	I was also roped in with a flier on my door, and ordered this a month or so ago when they had their deal for free cookies, salad, and drink with a pizza order.  Upon delivery, I was given another coupon for the same deal and a few weeks later received a handwritten thank you note for ordering with them and a coupon for a free order of cheesy bread, no purchase necessary.  Needless to say, this has become a go-to pizza option for me.  4 stars for food taste and quality, an extra for great service and good deals. Salad is pretty average but good enough for me with a pizza, pizza is particularly good, cookies are awesome, cheesy bread is cheesy enough but not just a pile of melted cheese.  Their sauce is really tasty- tastes fresh and not too sweet.  Delivery is free, and on time.  The longest time I've been quoted for a pizza (at 7:00 on a Saturday) was 45 minutes, and they got there in 23 minutes (I wasn't timing them but I did notice how quick they got there).  They have a hot'n'ready special that's only a dollar more than Little Sleazer's and ten times better.  And if you don't think it's good, you get your money back.  So really, you should just try it.  Okay?  Okay.
3879	1	a	"I took a road trip with the fellas to watch the LA Kings beat the Phoenix Coyotes @ the Jobing.com Arena and I must say our experience at this hotel far exceeded expectations!  Not only was the hotel suite very affordable when split between 4 guys (3 queen beds and 1 roll away all in 1 suite at no extra charge!), but the room was very nice, included a small refrigerator and microwave and was very comfortable!  Very new and modern and all we had to do was walk across the street to the whole Westgate Center/bars/restaurants/arena which was a HUGE plus!  At the end of a drunken debauchery filled night we stumbled back (a 5 minute walk) to our hotel safely!   We were going to stay a few miles away to save money but read some reviews about the hotels having ""bed bugs"" and being dirty.  You won't have that problem staying here!  The room was immaculate and the staff were beyond friendly and accommodating!  That was probably the best part:  Friendly staff!  The staff literally gave off a small town feel, the only time I've ever been treated better was at a bed and breakfast!  And  the morning breakfast was another thing that made this hotel worth it.  After drinking all night and being hung over, all we needed to do was stumble down to the lobby to get some eggs, sausage, ham, toast, bagels, waffles, apple and orange juice and we were re-fueled up for some more debauchery!  They had something for everyone, including a variety of cereals and  whatever you can think of for breakfast free of charge!    So if you're planning on staying anywhere near the Westgate center/Phoenix stadium/Jobing.com arena this is the place to stay!  We will definitely be staying here again the next time I'm out in AZ for a game!"
8764	1	a	Summary: not impressed.  Arrived early afternoon, ironically maybe that was the problem - there wasn't enough going on, place was dead. I would have hoped that a restaurant manager would realize that the few customers they may have at a slow time are just as important as those on a Friday night rush - standards are standards, you either have them or you don't.  Waitress was pleasant but not attentive - with a total of 3 occupied tables had to get up and get her attention for more chips. Chips though were very good; needed hotter salsa.  My friend had the steak fajitas; tasted OK but just luke warm. Fajitas are supposed to be sizzling hot; duh.  I had a so-so tamale and chicken enchilada. Enchilada was just warm, mostly a flat layer of cheese. Tamale filling was tasty shredded meat (as it should be) but corn meal was barely warm and almost tasted only partially cooked. Refried beans weren't warm enough to even melt the grated cheese sprinkled on top, which consequently then pulled off in a single congealed mass when I took a bite.   Finally, the Cadillac margaritas were just average at best.   $50 plus tip for two meals plus two margaritas; not worth it.  The place looked promising and has a cute patio area but we won't be back - someone's not watching the store. I'm trying to be generous with the two stars as some other Yelpers seem to like this place; maybe things can get better.
4757	1	a	I am not religious, but I will be the first person to admit I thank God for this place--and the neighboring Windsor. Seriously... a latte, ice cream on a waffle cone and a cocktail all within feet of each other. Dear Lord, I have reached bliss. I can die happy now.  Some people gripe that the flavors are not strong enough.  I prefer to gripe that they aren't open 24/7 because this is my bliss and damn it... I need it at all hours.  Always friendly. Always clean. Always awesome.  Yes, there is heaven.
4364	1	a	Both of the previous reviewers are correct, actually. Yes, there can be a line to the door at times, and not everyone working there is 100% nice 100% of the time. But who is? And, once you get to know them -- and are courageous enough to give them the benefit of the doubt -- everyone working there is very cool to deal with.  Because this Post Office is tucked way back in the Foothills, it's not staffed as heavily as I've seen some others. But the remoteness of the location also means you get to breeze in and out on rare occasions too (seeing as this is too far out of the way for any non-Foothills residents). So, do like me: never go here in a hurry; be polite; be patient (it's not all about you). And you'll see this is really no worse than any other Post Office...and maybe even a little bit better.
1198	1	a	It's 4:00 am on a Friday, you've just finished listening to awesome music and drinking too much, you're starving and want some good comfort food to fill your gut and soak up that alcohol..... enter Jerry's.  The place was open.  The place was clean.  The food was good.  The service was great.  The prices were great.  WAY better than a Denny's, better than most diner's I've been to, actually.  I had ham and eggs and the plate was delicious.  The ham steak was gigantic, the eggs perfect, and hash browns were done just right... crispy and good.
547	1	a	Home sweet home love it ...only wish is more hot water for showers other than that it's a great place to live
5920	1	a	Tott's is great pan-Asian food for a very reasonable price.    One day at work one of my co-workers asked if I wanted to go out to lunch.  I agreed and we set out.  We each got 1 veto.  Hers was Panda Express, mine was Kyoto Bowl.  We kept driving and she remembered Tott's, and I've never bothered going to Panda again.  Great food and great service.  The owner is a small Asian man who smiles a lot and always wants to know if he can get us anything else.  I see him every time I go.  Everyone I go with loves their orange chicken.  It is very tasty, but a little on the sweet side for me.  I like a spicy dish, so I go with the Malaysian Curry.  Chicken, red curry, fresh veggies, fried rice.  Amazing.
8166	1	a	Very friendly but need to work on the bathroom
9181	1	a	As a visitor to Scottsdale, I thought a stroll through the farmers market was a great way to get a taste of the local flavor--literally. And it was! There's a great mix of vendors, who sell everything from baked goods to coffee, from vegan wraps to preserves. There are also some interesting services like pet massages!  Like Vicky T. said, it was surprising to see dogs with their owners wandering through the farmers market, because that's against code in California. But I thought it was great, and with the pet masseuse and a doggy and kitty treat vendor, it totally made sense.  Farm Sessions, where local chefs give cooking demos with produce from the market, is a great idea I'd like to see at my local farmers market. It did seem odd, though, that all the produce at the market was in one corner. It was the shadiest spot, so maybe that's why?  Anyway, this was a great way to spend a Saturday morning and was very relaxing compared to my local farmers markets, where I often feel like I need to start throwing some elbows to get through the crowd.
1298	1	a	"I dined at this restaurant on a Saturday morning and was actually the very first guest.  I got greeted by the hostess and was promptly seated.  The service was phenomenal from when I walked over the door step and the ambiance is the restaurant was amazing .  I ordered the smoked salmon as an appetizer and the daily scallop special as the entree.  When my salmon dish came out I said to my self ""WHAT in the hell?"" Two extremely thin slices of salmon, little salad, and a piece of bread with some aioli on the side.  Salmons cheap and they charged me $15 for this crap?  I work in the food industry and the food was crap.  Next, the entree.  The waiter described the the scallop dish like it was heaven on earth.  Explaining to me how delicious this special was.  So I took his advice and ordered.  When the dish came out I said to my self again ""What in the HELL?""  Four small scallops, 2 baby carrots, broccoli rabe, and cilantro sauce.  The scallops weren't seared enough, the broccoli rabe was brown and mush, and the baby carrots were still raw.  The funny thing was.  The sauce didn't even resemble any cilantro flavor at all.  I could of made this dish 1000x better and the entree took a big hit in my wallet, $32 for crap.  The meal came out to roughly $60 and I left that restaurant to never try it again.  I could of gotten some pho for $8 would of been a hundred times happier than spending money that wasn't even mediocre."
5625	1	a	"I've always wanted to go to Rokerij and when my date suggested it last night - I was all for it!  I was NOT disappointed.    We spent our evening downstairs in what I can only describe as ""speak-easy"" atmosphere reminiscent of my days spent in the DC area.  I loved it.  Decor was spot on with stone walls, a fire place with comfy leather chairs strategically placed in front.  A big bar took up most of the room with some comfy look booths placed around the outskirts of the room. Lots of great details in decorations and design.  Our bartender was friendly and efficient. His suggestions on wine (1/2 price bottle!) and the manhattan we had were spot on.  He checked in with us and was attentive, but not overly so, letting us enjoy each other's company.    We tried 3 of the small plates:  the roasted pepper bruschetta, tenderloin skewers and the bacon wrapped shrimp.  Honestly, I was expecting to be hungry afterwards and was ready to order something else in addition to that, but we held off until we received our food and I'm glad we did. The portions were pretty large and food rich.  Everything tasted great...the bacon and tenderloin were served on long plates that had 3 different sauces...a creamy queso (I think), a spicy red sauce and a green tomatillo-like sauce.  The red and green were really good - the white was a bit bland....but I'm also not a fan of cream sauces, so don't take my word for it.  The bruschetta was more of an italian style bruschetta (bread, peppers layered on top with melted cheese).  Tasted good, but my only complaint would be that it got a little mushy because there was so much topping on it. My date enjoyed it.  Overall, a great experience. I can't wait to go back - especially when looking for a laid back, cool atmosphere. And I definitely want to try more of the food!"
3338	1	a	"I agree with the other reviewers.. Ink bomb is definitely a shop that has a family vibe. All the tattooers are down to earth and have you, their customer in mind. There are usually 3 or 4 tattooers there, giving you a wide variety on technique, style, and experience.. all of which are important when picking your tattooer. I suggest always going in and having a consultation and looking at each persons portfolio to choose someone who fits your style whether it be ""New school"" or ""Traditional""   This shop has on open layout and a friendly vibe which allows your to let your guard down a bit.. because we all know tattoo shops can be intimidating.... I will definitely be recommending this to all my friends and family."
6714	0	a	The worse food and service. I have never given a bad review. I ordered a shrimp dish with brown rice. The waiter brought out white rice. The sauce was horrible and bland. The calamari salad was not fresh. The dressing was bland too. The waitress checked on us and we asked for check immediately.  She never asked if anything was wrong or if the food was good. I would never recommend or eat here again. The service and food was horrible. I was visiting from out of town and was hoping to get a new experience.  This was not it...
2848	1	a	In town for business, and came to Pappadeaux's for dinner...what a great experience.  Hostess, wait staff, and servers were all outstanding.  The food was amazing.  Perfectly cooked vegetables to accompany the Costa Rican Mahi.  Ice cold beer on a hot, 102 degree day was a welcome addition!  Although we later found out our waiter was in training (it was his first day), he was attentive, professional, and available to answer any questions we had.  Highly recommended.
1335	1	a	This is a very pretty and very chic looking restaurant, and I hoped that the food was as good as the decor.  My friend and I had the sangria and the mojito, and then we shared a bruschetta and the garlic pizza.  I found the sangria a little on the acidic side, but drinkable, and it was fortified with something, because it was a lot stronger than it tasted.  My friend's mojito was good.  I LOVED the bruschetta. Not only were the toppings well-planned and delicious, but the bread had a nice crunch and a slightly smoky fire-baked taste to it. Ditto for the pizza, in which the crust shared the stage with the toppings.  Don't expect cheese-red sauce-and-pepperoni type pizzas, as you might expect from the look of the place, the pizza is artisianal.  Nearly half the seating is out on the patio, and one unusual feature is that the seats were low and the tables as well.  This makes it a good place to relax with your friends (as you feel like you're sitting on patio furniture) but harder to eat your food.  We had good service the night we went (a weeknight, around 8:30).  Zero wait for our table, and prompt, polite service.  I would definitely go here again.
9154	1	a	Good, quick option in downtown phoenix. We dined here before a Suns game and we got in and out with great service and delicious food in under 45 minutes. The Pho was very good, as was the noodle dish I ordered.
4293	1	a	Super cheap and good! I loved how large the portions were, the squid salad came in a large bowl and was delicious. We will definitely be returning.
9069	1	a	I love the Starbucks in the Safeway here. Marissa...the girl who is normally the barista...is so nice!
5901	1	a	Please for the love of God, don't microwave eggs.  If not for that, this review would be a 3 or 3.5 stars, but seriously, eggs don't like microwavization. Just ruined the whole panini egg sandwich for me.  The coffee was pretty good. They had a selection of 4 going from light to dark which is nice. Lots of places have you choosing between a full city and a french which is frustrating.  Service was very friendly, but a tad slow for the number of people that were working there. I think they were focused on a lot of large pickup orders, but when you sell bagels by the barrel, you should expect that.  Saw some people picking up said bagel barrels, they mentioned how their office would cheer upon their arrival and heap laurels and praise on their shoulders. They boasted that their upcoming performance review was assuredly positive with such accolades. I smiled at them and wished them the best in their fantasy worlds.   Scottsdale methinks is full of fantasy in this desert oasis.
4689	1	a	Wow. Best breakfast I had on my recent trip to Scottsdale. Ordered the eggs benedict with a side of corned beef hash. Waitress sweet talked the cook into making a side order since they typically don't do side dishes. That sweet little angel of a waitress made my day! Best corned beef hash EVER! Have I mentioned how awesome the waitresses were? And damn pretty as well. Double score.
7436	1	a	"I had an amazing dinner tonight at Quiessence.  When we made the reservation they asked if we were celebrating anything; we were, so when we sat down we were given 3 glasses of complimentary champagne.    We started with a plate of three delicious cheeses.  They have a huge selection of cheeses, probably about 20, and we chose a goat, a smoked gouda and a jack.  All delicious and served with crostini, perfectly melt-in-your-mouth bartlett pears, pecans, honey and quince paste.  Great start.  Our next course we shared two salads - an octopus carpaccio and field green salad.  Both good.  My main course was AMAZING.  It was heritage turkey with mashed potatoes and carrots.  I ate every bite.  SO flavorful.  My dad had a beef sirloin that was perfectly cooked and delicious with a side of fingerling potatoes.  My mom got swordfish.  It was not cooked properly when it first came out, but they promptly corrected the problem, so i can't fault them for that.  The ambience was great including a live but not distracting singer and a warm crackling fireplace.  In addition, I want to give big props to the servers for knowing everything about the food they served.  She knew where the fish was caught, how the beef was raised, what certifications the turkey farm had achieved.  It is great to be able to get those kind of answers with zero attitude when you ask the question.  My only reservations would be 1) definitely is ""slow"" food, maybe a tad too slow but so delicious it was worth it and they said they were short staffed and 2) i'm not sure i buy that their seafood is sustainable.  They served atlantic cod and atlantic swordfish.  My understanding is that both of these fish stocks are pretty severely depleted.  I asked and was told that the fisherman they buy from are committed to sustainable methods, but I'm not sure (personally, for me, at least) that it is possible to sustainably fish a stock that is in danger.  All in all though, a fantastic night and i can't wait to return!"
2056	1	a	Tip:  If you know how to play poker...go sit at a poker table, and order the fried rice.  You get your meal for half price while playing poker.  The filet mignon fried rice(ask for it rare and it will come out medium) is excellent!
2159	1	a	I love Lulus cupcakes! They always have a perfect amount of frosting and alot of their cupcakes are better than the ones at sprinkles. This is because they seem to be moister and hold themselves together better.  I love the raven! The Sales people are nice.  So yummy! And I love that the place is pink!
7153	1	a	Always fresh and perfectly prepared. This is the only place my husband will take Japanese visitors from out of town. Enough said.
656	1	a	"Q. How do you fix a broken pizza? A. With tomato paste!  Ok, that sucked.  Spin-at-O's pizza is actually how it's pronounced as the owner learned to make pizza in Baltimore MD home of the Orioles or O's for short. Ok, I just made ALL that stuff up but it would have been cool. Right?  Spinato""s pizza and calzones are amazing. Very heavy and sauce rich. If you're on a diet STAY AWAY. If you're not calorie counting-COME HERE. Their thin pizza is very thin and very good! We got the baked spaghetti w/meatballs calzone and it was what you'd expect but wow was it great.   Only downside after eating here: FOOD COMA ZZZZZzzzzzzZzzzzz :)"
3718	1	a	My favorite restaurant in AZ, No Contest!!! Awesome staff, delicious food and the best salsa!!!!
2142	1	a	I am a big fan of this place, either to stop in on a slow Sunday just to see what they have.  Their stock rotates pretty frquently so always new interesting things to find.  So far I've bought a vintage print, an awesome dress that I have received tons of compliments on, cool earrings, and some other kitchen items.  The staff are always friendly.  When you go, make sure you check out the Burt Reynolds beefcake poster they have behind the counter.  Great strore!
6802	1	a	"I don't remember shopping at this location prior to the remodel.  I can see myself shopping here much more often in the future.  I'm already thinking about how much it sucks to shop in the summer when it's 110 - but covered parking?!?  oh, yeah, I'll be there in the summer.  Nice and clean, easy to shop, wide aisles, no clutter in the end caps.  SO easy to shop this store.  Went in today for an advertised price on chicken that we were planning on having tonight.  Asked the meat guy if there was any more chicken left.  Was told that they were sold out.  I told him that the reason we came to his store was because of the price and we were planning on eating the chicken tonight with dinner guests.  I asked if he could sub something, and he said, ""SURE, no problem!""  Friendly, helpful, super easy.  I also mentioned that the last time we came in, I bought something with a manager special sticker on it but was charged the regular price.  The customer service guy refunded my money with no questions!  Awesome.  Great store, nice selection of bulk items, fresh produce, large service deli, in house bakery with some incredible looking treats, clean.....  I'll definitely be shopping at Bashas!  As if I could rave anymore, it's a LOCALLY owned business!"
3260	1	a	You've seen the storyline play out many times - great athlete in his prime signs a multi-year mega-contract, but eventually his body betrays him and he's parked on the bench, getting paid more than the starters.  Valle Luna, I'm looking at you.  My family used to frequent this place - you could get a nice meal for $8 or $9 per person, and their food was fantastic.  But Valle Luna has lost a step.  You see it here and there - the chimi sauce isn't quite the same, the beans are inconsistent, and the fundido just isn't as fun.  And to make matters worse, Valle Luna now demands superstar prices, asking for around $20 for a chimichanga dinner.  I hate to break this to you, guys, but I can get that - and done better - for much cheaper.  And don't even get me started on the rise of Rito's, Chipotle, and Juan's, all of which provide superior food for less than half the price.  Their prices have become ridiculous - and I think Valle Luna knows it, because this is one of the only restaurants I can think of that creates a version of their menu WITH NO PRICES for their website.  I'm serious: http://www.valleluna.com/VL_Menu3.html  It looks exactly like the regular menu, just without any idea of how crazy expensive their food has become.  I suppose they figure that you can't (or won't) leave after you've sat down, ordered drinks, and eaten some chips?  But much like that past-his-prime athlete, Valle Luna still has one move that reminds you of those glory days, like Jordan's fade-away jumper.  It was his best shot late in his career because it was the only shot he could cleanly get off.   Valle Luna's fried ice cream is so delicious, and since it's dessert, they can't charge $18 for it.   I wish I could tell you the exact price but that's censored on the online menu, too.     So go for dessert sometime soon and reminisce about the glory days, because I suspect it won't be long before the game passes Valle Luna by and they're forced to hang up the aprons.
4254	1	a	The staff here made the place awesome. They were friendly, on top of things (including when I lost my cell phone), and didn't really blink an eye at the crazy antics of the adult webmasters.  I loved how close they are to food, bars, and even adult romance store on Mill -- I could just walk through the court yard and hit Rula Bula and RA.  However, I had two things I didn't like as much. A) there wasn't enough non-outdoor, non-sunny space to hang out in. Yes, it's Phoenix and people come here to get tan...but I live here, and burn ridiculously easily. Yet everything was in the sun, because there was no large, sun-free area.  Also, b) while the lobby, courtyard and seminar rooms were nice, the hallways and actual hotel rooms seemed a bit outdated. Also, trying to find the pool with no signs? Not so much fun.  All in all, a nice hotel and the perfect place to hold a pervert conference. I'm sure I'll be back at some point!
3016	1	a	"Meh.  My standards for quality froyo are high since I frequent Yogurtology (Shea and Scottsdale), Yogurtland (I'm the Duke in Scottsdale), and sometimes I go to Mojo in Tempe.   This place has ""ok"" flavors. I had the original tart, that was quite a bit tart. The toppings are ok. My friend really liked the fact that they have banana chips, but that's because we usually eat our froyo at home and we were far away from home, and she didn't have to use her personal stash.   Since it made her happy, I gave this place an extra star. I'm cool like that.  Hmm...let's see. They have a snow machine. Not really sure what this is for. It seems out of place.   It's far from my house, and not really worth my drive. I guess if it was by my house, and I had no other options, I'd frequent this business.   This is the one time, and one time only that I will say this.....Thank God, I live in Old Town Scottsdale."
9909	1	a	When I moved away, these were the tacos that I missed!   I stopped back today, and must say - it was exactly how I remembered!  The lunch specials are very reasonably priced at $5.99 and come with two items and rice and beans. I always get the hard taco - seasoned shredded beef, lettuce, and cheese in a deep fried corn tortilla - and the cheese enchilada. I could eat the rice and beans alone, both are so well seasoned and they definitely don't skimp on the cheese! The only thing to watch is that the red hot sauce can vary from visit to visit - some days it's super hot, others - not so much.  The wait staff is exceptionally friendly and always try to help me because my Spanish is so limited. The interior is large but very modest, there aren't a lot of fancy decorations - this is a place to come for the food and service and  not th ambiance.   Still, one of my faves!
6447	1	a	What a dream come true to traipse into this store with my toddler girl and my husband. The store is filled, ceiling to floor, with all varieties of toys for all age groups. Shelves upon shelves of brands and models you've likely never seen if your main toy-shopping stomping grounds are Toys R Us or Walmart. The store's management clearly has a relaxed attitude about children playing in the store -- toys are sprawled across the store,  ready for the next child's little hands. Yet, it didn't feel messy in there. The aisles are wide and smooth. The store is organized into various zones. (Dolls, science, blocks, books, baby, etc.)  This is an absolute oasis in suburbia land where you're always hard-pressed to find non-chain stores.
8621	0	a	Extremely slow service, hostess and manager were both rude. I noticed that 2 tables that sat after we did got served first.   4 out of every 10 people that walked in, walked right back out once they saw the line.   We waited 35 minutes for a table. This was my first and last time at this over priced Denny's
4084	1	a	"This is my second time in Chandler for work, and I've been here about four times.  I've basically come here every day during my visits.  It's a great place to have a casual meal and get some more work done.  I like the food and the friendly service, and also refuse to pay for the wireless in my hotel room (even though my employer would reimburse me for it).  Plus, I like the relaxed, community-esque feel of this place.  As for the food, I'd recommend the Tuscan Chicken sandwich - the Ciabatta bread it comes on is really quite delicious, but make sure it's fresh.  salads are simple, but pretty good, and everything tastes fresh.  The chocolate chip cookies are to-die-for.    The people who work here are very friendly.  One guy was particularly helpful and helped me as I contemplated for about five minutes what I should get.  He then came to check how my food was, even though this is a self-service type of place.    I would not recommend the half-sandwich half-salad combo if you're really hungry.  Somehow a whole sandwich seemed more filling to me.  Even though I avoid chain restaurants, I really like this one!  Maybe it's because we don't have one in Northern California, so it still makes me feel like this is ""something different""."
2303	1	a	best coffee in phoenix (so far). experienced and friendly baristas, a large sitting area inside, nice decorations, community conscious, promotes local art and artists, outdoor sitting area, easily accessible location from the light rail and from the portland park neighborhood.   i had a short vanilla cappuccino and the thing that made it the best insofar to my search for phoenix's best espresso was definitely the milk. it was properly steamed microfoam. the shots were right on, too.  the milk i've had elsewhere in phoenix doesn't compare. thumbs up to fair trade.
9982	1	a	We brought the entire family to Giuseppe's last night for a pre-Thanksgiving meal... yes, that's right - my family likes to carb up for all of the eating we do today!  We brought a ton of wine and had a great time.  Franco was our waiter - and I'm guessing since all the ladies at the table had a crush on him, that he is the waiter Sheila B wrote about in her review too.  Nice eye candy!  I absolutely love the eggplant rollatini and pretty much order it every visit.  We usually start with a Giuseppe's Salad and finish with a dessert to share.  My favorite is the white chocolate tartufa.  Pasquale (pictured above) is the sweetest man and makes the experience extra special every single time.    Since I'm writing this review on Thanksgiving, I want to give thanks to Pasquale and Ristorant Giuseppe for all the good times I've had there and all of the good times to come!  Salud!
7068	1	a	"As a vegetarian and sporadic health nut, I just love TJ's. They have a nice array of inexpensive fresh produce, including my beloved broccolini, for 40% of what Safeway charges. Huge selection of frozen veggie-friendly dinners, good for my on-the-go household. Greek yogurt, cheap. Nice beer selection with lots of cheapo wine. I try to buy all my supplements here too, as they seem to be a lot less expensive. Yes, I'm all about saving cash on groceries and whatnot.  The downside? It's not one-stop-shopping; a trip always requires supplementation with another trip to a ""regular"" grocery store. This particular TJ's is teeny-tiny-small, and always chock-full of obnoxious and/or oblivious people who wield carts like weapons. My favorite is the woman who thinks it's an awesome time to teach little Jimmy how to push his own wee cart and comparison shop, and lets the little bastard cruise all over the store willy-nilly. I'm all for giving your kid responsibility, but a) you still have to, you know, keep an eye on the kid and b) a super-crowded claustrophobic nightmare like this place after work is not, repeat, NOT the time to do so."
3682	1	a	awesome iconic eatery! whenever i visit az i make it a point to stop off at this ultra friendly, fantastic tasting joint.   yeah, it takes a while to figure out the ordering process, but the staff is super helpful, and after the first or second time, one can figure out the system. it's just that everything is abbreviated which requires some thought.   i usually mix 2 entrees to get different flavors. love the jerk chicken and fiery pollo diablo.  although they are known for their snicker doodles, my dessert is usually ordering another entree to take home for later!   hands down one of my favorite eateries. i wish we had one in minneapolis, mn...i would probably eat there daily for lunch, ha!
7328	1	a	Delicious, cheap (for how much you actually get), and oh yeah, delicious.  I LOVE this place. I easily take home enough food for 3 meals. Great variety and nice people.
5692	1	a	"One of my favorites. The crispy chicken tacos are overstuffed with meat,lettuce,cheese and always filling. The prices are reasonable for what you get. Also like Julios g  too next door for quick take out  or ""no Tip"" casual meal. Self serve chips and mild chunky salsa  are terrific."
4873	1	a	My fiancee and I found this place on-line when we were looking fot sushi in the Central Phoenix area. Neither of us had heard of it but we decided to give it a go. We got there around 8:30 and the place was kindof empty so we were a little nervous. We walked in and were seated at a table by the window. We were seated with dinner menus but not a sushi menu. Ther server said they only give those out at the sushi bar. I thought that was a little wierd but the server was nice and the decor was hip and modern (it was metrosexual according to my fiancee) so we went with it.   We ordered lots and lots of sushi - ika salad, hamachi sashimi ($9), spicy tuna roll ($7), shrimp tempura roll ($7), and the sunshine roll ($11) (spicy salmon with lemon on top). We could not complain about anything! It was all very very good. It tasted fresh, yummy, and hit the spot. The total bill was $47.00 which sounded about right considering how much food we ordered!   We liked the decor, the service, and the food. I noticed they had a lunch menu so I will be taking my co-workers back with me next time!
2131	1	a	"I had business downtown this morning, so I stopped in here for lunch, right around the corner.  I used to go to OSF in Newport Beach, CA way back in the '70s, & I was somewhat amazed that they are still around & that there's one in Phoenix!  Stepping inside, this is the most junked-up restaurant I've ever been to!!!  Ok, except maybe Bahooka Ribs & Grog!*  It's a big place, with soft lighting inside, & rooms all over the place stuffed with tons of furniture, barrels, & so on, cluttering up every one of them!  It's all on purpose, of course, & my booth in the midst of all this craziness was actually completely ok.  (The floor elevation is up & down all over the place, too!)   Ok, so for my first time (in about 35 years!) I just ordered the ""Pasta Classics - Rich Meat Sauce"", which is their way of saying, ""Spaghetti.""  Some good things:  *  I started with a cup of coffee, & it was excellent!  *  Pretty soon came a mixed lettuce salad, which was simple, but the Ranch Dressing was really tasty!  *  The next thing to hit the table was a little loaf about three by eight inches of hot Sourdough bread, with a cup of whipped garlic butter, all on a breadboard with a suitable knife for cutting it.  It was great!!  A couple of less wonderful things:  *  Some girl (from the kitchen?) brought my spaghetti before I was finished with my salad.  *  I thought the spaghetti sauce was ok, but not great.  Bottom line:  They give you plenty to eat here.  My meal included the beverage, salad (or soup), the hot bread, entree, & dessert.  It was nice & filling, & a good value at $9.99 for everything.    :-)  *  Rosemead, CA (& formerly also West Covina)."
4724	1	a	I've only been once to the Thai Hut, and it was after the Museum visit, as it's right across the street. Combine two cranky parents and two tired kids and it could have been an unpleasant dinner. But Thai Hut servers were very accomodating, the food was delicious and they were friendly about my kids checking out the fish and stuff... I'd go back again, for sure.
964	1	a	FAN-FREAKIN' -TASTIC!  Yes, it's a Great steakhouse... but they also have a Great wine selection... and Great bread to start... and Great desserts.... and Great service.  Rich and Richie took exceptional care of us.  They were attentive and fun to talk to... too.  I had the Prime Rib and it was huge and perfectly prepared. I ended up taking the rest home and having it for lunch the next day and it was just as good the following day.  :)  The Bread to start came with 2 different flavored butters.  You could easily fill up on bread before dinner.... so go easy on this as they will keep bringing out refills if you let them.  The Dessert.... we got the Chocolate Lava Cake... and the cake part was good... but the sides that came with the cake... they were Amazing.  The Chantilly Cream they serve on the side of the cake is freshly made and it's a Little Pillow of Heaven.  Rich brought us more when we ate all the cream and still had cake left.  And then they have a little homemade pistachio cookie with vanilla ice cream on the side too... these were great too... So, net, net... I wouldn't order the Chocolate Lava Cake for the cake part.... I'd order it for the things that come WITH the cake.  :)  Good for special occassions and if you are looking to have a lovely evening out.
6502	1	a	Fun neighborhood bar, with a new backroom filled with fun games such as skeeball!
5578	1	a	So yummy! Strange combination but great place
6584	1	a	The Best hash brown casserole ever! My daughter loved the apples and sweet yogurt. The Staff was super friendly. going back this week
7892	0	a	"Any time I have out of town visitors who want ""real"" Mexican, I take them here. The chips are fresh, the salsa is divine, and after downing two baskets, you realize you need to eat an entree! I've eaten a variety off the menu, and nothing has disappointed me. The burros are stuffed full, the crisps are mouthwatering and the enchiladas melt in your mouth. The ONLY downside is the location. Just not a great part of town, though they are trying very hard to revitalize it. Go there anyway! Just try lunch time first."
2919	1	a	I think for my sesquicentennial review, I've gotten to a point where I'm letting the food direct the show of stars. Sure, we have the servers and cooks as producers, the location as our stage, lighting, sound and supporting staff. But the meal, ah, that is our celebrated lead actor. Without it, all other pieces may paint a pretty picture, but what good is a painting when it medium is missing?   The Mission really delivers its lines well. Almost too well. Like Dakota Fanning well. Each plate has a spectrum of flavors--bold and smoky with subtle and delicate undertones of fresh herbs. Each dish is skillfully plated and ready for its closeup. My steak tacos were so intensely flavored, I didn't really dwell on the fact there were but three petite tortilla shells mounded with strips of magnificently grilled flank steak and slices of fresh avocado. And the papas y chorizo, which I ordered as an accompaniment, helped balance the palate yet was still a strong item on its own. Robert M's pozole was as unique as it was flavorful, delicious, satisfying and, ironically, humble. The bread pudding he ordered at the end of meal was, according to him, a premature ejaculation. Apparently, that means it was good, so I'll take his word for that. Those who joined us for this meal seemed to share some of the enthusiasm over the dessert, but I don't eat sweets so will have to believe their accolades worthy.   What, pray tell, denies The Mission of the much clamored five-star rating? Primarily, it's the associated fees. On one hand, I was blown away by the sensuous flavors apparent in every edible item. On the other hand, I was blown away upon seeing the bill (especially since I had nothing but water to drink). Does one negate the other? Perhaps. Am I at a place in my life where such a statement rings true? Not necessarily. While my initial response was, I wouldn't likely return to The Mission if it was my decision, I confess that I would, willingly, give myself back to The Mission if only for the sublime sins of doting on sustenance.
7516	1	a	The Lodge has been a pretty consistent happy hour spot for me over the last year and a half. Their food and drink specials are a great way to wrap up the week on a Friday night. I like their chicken strips and the cheese curds are great. The pretzels are also delicious. Service is typically pretty good, you'll be able to keep drinks coming and food comes out quickly. There's a lot of entertainment there, with corn hole and giant jenga outside, and some video games and a pool table inside.   I don't love the Lodge as much for a prime time or late night spot...It gets a lot more expensive and a lot more crowded. Go for happy hour, order some cheese curds and a $3 Miller Lite and you're bound to have a good time. The decor is kinda fun, there are random acts of taxidermy inside and it's very, uh...Log cabin like.  A funny (but pretty well known) fact about this place is that Jared Allen (Minnesota Vikings) is a part owner of The Lodge, so from time to time you may run into him and some other NFLers there.
7014	0	a	"Pei Wei is always busy, that's gotta mean something right? Wrong. There are restaurants that serve billions yet all they serve is a gross mystery. Pei Wei is no mystery though, the food is cooked in an open air kitchen. Even so, if there were such a thing as Asian fast food, Pei Wei would be cleaner version of it.  Most Pei Wei's are situated in pompous locations where ever there is an AJ Fine Foods, but atleast they aren't located in the ghetto.  As far as the food goes, it is about as Americanized as you can get. So if you live in America and have American taste buds, it will appeal to you. Unfortunately if you want authentic Asian food you won't find it at Pei Wei. I don't understand why they even bother to put chopsticks on the table, the rice isn't even sticky enough to pick it up with. They are for decoration. They are part of the 'fake' Asian dining experience. Apparently, Pei Wei serves food ""manadrian style"" from Thailand, Vietnam, Japan, Korea, and China. In the words of Bill Lumbergh, ""Ooo.. yeahh.. I'm just not sure about that."" Having traveled to China I can honestly tell you that Chinese food is different. Apart from the rice, the food lacks vegetable oil and garlic. In China those two ingrediants are used in many dishes and Pei Wei lacks them. When I first started visiting Pei Wei I ordered the Sweet and Sour, but I got sick of it. Sometimes the meat would be tough, sometimes the chicken would clump together all nastily. What I get now-a-days and what I got on this particular day was Mandarin Kung Pao. Even though the dish is spicy, that doesn't mean it has to be dry - and it was. What it was missing was some catalyst to bring out the spicy flavors and make them more vibrant.  The dishes at Pei Wei are family style meaning they are meant to be shared with several people. A dish and a drink will end up costing you about $10. If each person gets one dish, that's a lot of food, probably enough to feed a small village in Africa somewhere. It would be nice if they served each dish in two styles, family and single, large and small. Family style is great if you always visit Pei Wei with your family. But if you are out for lunch with people from work you might not want to share your food with your co-workers. They aren't your family. You don't know them.  Pei Wei is a modern Asian diner that is probably better than most of the mom and pop Asian diners out there, even if most of the food is cooked by Mexi-- I mean Asians."
5378	1	a	We are picky about food because we try to eat healthy. Owner and server were very accommodating and courteous. They took time to understand what we want and delivered on it. One gripe, we had difficulty finding it because neon sign was not working. We had a great experience.
805	1	a	First, and most importantly, every person I've met at QC Vet Clinic has been super!  They are caring and wonderful with my dogs.  They are never too busy to smile and give great service when I come through the door.  They have even taken time to share stories and pictures of their own pets.  Second, they understand that some people must take a fiscally conservative approach with the care of their pets.  They discussed all options thoroughly with me and I performed the care that was needed a little at a time -- as it was needed.  This was important to me since many vets that we've visited in the past have handed us an estimate for hundreds or thousands of dollars and wouldn't budge -- insisting that we HAD to do ALL the work listed.  At QC Vet Clinic, I didn't feel like I was judged for that decision.  Unfortunately, we had a small mistake that I discussed with the vet.  She listened and gave appropriate feedback to my concerns.  This is really the only thing that is preventing a 5 star rating.  Overall they are still the best vet I've visited and I will continue to put my pets lives in their very capable hands.  BTW, we had to have a pet put down because he was ill. The team at QC Vet Clinic was absolutely the best!  They were so empathetic and even sent us a sympathy card with a little surprise inside... I won't give it away, but it was so very special to my family.  It's the little things in life that fill our hearts...thanks QC Vet Clinic!
5081	1	a	For a pretty yuppie place, Desert Ridge has a decent enough assortment of shops, assuming of course you can find them.  Sure, you can theoretically pick up some new accents for your living room, a new pair of shoes, some books and the materials to make new candle rings in one go after which you involve yourself with movies and a beer, but you may give up in frustration before you ever find a place to park.  I dearly hope whoever laid this place out is no longer in charge of such projects.  There is no logic whatsoever to the layout.  Trying to drive between the lots can verge on nightmarish.  Needlessly huge islands in the parking lot put leaves in the way of ever finding what's across the way, so navigating the place on foot is often out of the question without even taking the Phoenix summer heat and wretched drivers into consideration.  Desert Ridge probably isn't going anywhere.  I've never been there that it wasn't busy.  It's almost impossible to avoid if you have any significant shopping to do.  But, the restaurants here don't tend to last long.  They come and go before Yelp can ever get to them, leaving an endless strand of big box outlets and bastions of poor fashion sense.
455	1	a	"This place is great!   I've eaten here twice now and both times the food has been wonderful.  I've driven by this place for years and it always looked closed to me.   The windows are very dark.   My husband's barber told him his customers (the barber's) drive all the way from Scottsdale to eat here.    We decided to try it out after hearing this and reading good reviews about it on Yelp.   The first time we went for dinner.  I had the Osso Bucco and my husband had Seafood Paella.   Both were great.  I've had  Osso Bucco in high end restaurants that couldn't compare to this.   The second time we ate here for lunch.   Husband had the Philly Cheesesteak with Peppers, Onions, and Mushrooms.  I had the spaghetti and meatballs.   I had some of his sandwich and we both agreed it was the best Cheesteak we've ever had.  The sandwiches are loaded with fillings and are not salty.   Spaghetti and Meatballs were good but I like Babbo's and Humble Pie's better.    I would have given it five stars but the atmosphere is not the best.   Our first waiter even told us they do have the reputation for being a hole in the wall.   The service is very casual with no sense of urgency.  On our second visit for lunch our waitress told us she had been there over five years and they have quite a few regulars.    Both times we have visited the restaurant was almost full.    Try this place out even though it is a ""hole in the wall."""
5410	1	a	For some reason this reminds me a bit of Dukes in Waikiki. Food is OK, not bad, not good either. Service is OK, not bad, not good. The best part about this place is that they don't have a cover and its easy to get into. Its good for a beer on a pub crawl or to sober up for a couple of hours b4 2am. One of my coworkers literally drops $100's here per week and I don't think hes ever gotten a free beer. I think that says something about the place.
4956	1	a	2 stars all because the hot sauce sucks now. 2 stars: 1 for a Buckeye Icon and 1 for most of the food is not bad.  Service is bad and slow. Servers are not trained in good service skills. Dirt parking lot sucks, be carefull not fall into one of the holes. Hope you are not handicapted and have to use the bathroom.....it's outside and to the left, suprised the Building department OK'd this place.
8670	1	a	"I am 5'0"", so I require a lot of alterations and it is essential that I have a good alteration service.  I will never go anywhere other than Elegant Reflections for my tailoring services.  I have had innumerable pairs of pants hemmed here and have been completely satisfied.  They have nice private dressing rooms with real doors (I refuse to undress behind nothing more than a curtain), everyone on staff is competent and very friendly, the prices are reasonable, and they are almost always able to complete your alterations in less than a week.  I have only ever encountered one issue..when I had two pair of very thick trousers hemmed with a cuff at the bottom, the cuff seemed loose.  Since I didn't want it to get caught on something and come apart, I took them back to be adjusted.  The second alteration was done in just a couple days (in winter, which tends to be a busy busy time for them) and the new stitching was nearly indestructible!  The staff here also seems to have an exceptional memory, because even after a year hiatus- they greeted me by name!"
5291	1	a	In town for our 5 year wedding anniversary.  Sushi is one of our favs, so, after doing some reading on Yelp, off we went to Sakana.  I must agree with many other Yelpers...the nigiri is fantastic!  Huge, tasty pieces of super fresh fish.  I'm craving it now as I'm writing this!  I'm so glad I read the reviews and ordered several items from the nigiri menu...it was fantastic.    The rolls, while well priced, were a little disappointing.  Maybe it was just our selections, but nothing really jumped out at us...everything was pretty bland.  We asked our server for recommendations and everything was a California roll plus this or that.  Pretty blah.  Even the Mexican Caliente Roll was rather uneventful.  The service was awesome.  Everyone was friendly, efficient, well organized.  The atmosphere was rather mainstream, which was fine with me.  I did have to laugh, as the first song we heard when we sat down was a Pitbull song, which another reviewer bemoaned.  The volume wasn't offensive, so it really only served to make me laugh.   The customer appreciation menu and Kirin beer special is genius.  So many customer appreciation menus are pretty sparse, but theirs is well fleshed out and offers a lot of options.  We each ordered Kirins while we waited for our table (we were told it would be 15-20 minutes, but it was maybe 5 minutes) and got 2 appetizers for 50 cents each.  Pretty cool.  (The scallop poppers were yummy.  The edemame was, well, edamame.  Not a huge serving, but what do you want for .50?)  All in all, a good dinner.  We know when we go for sushi that it's probably going to be a pricy night.  Not at Sakana...it was probably the best meal we had in Scottsdale at the very best price.  If we're back in town, we will definitely return.  I'll just get more creative in my roll selection...or maybe just stick with the nigiri :)  Yum!
2134	1	a	The chicken was unreal good!  And, the cornbread, just as reviewers stated was heavenly.  It was light and very good!
3382	1	a	I first saw them Saturday morning at the Phoenix Public Market and told myself that I would have to try them soon. I was too full from all the sampling with the different vendors. My coworkers and I went to check out the food trucks that gather on Thursday outside of Whole Foods by Raintree and the 101. I saw that Mojo Bowl was there and made my mind up right away to get their food.  I decided to get the Red, White, and Kale salad. I love quinoa and kale so it was the obvious choice for me. I also wanted to try one of their smoothies out. I went with the Coco Coca. The description mentioned that it was like a drinkable Almond Joy and I was sold right there. The total came to $13, not too shabby considering the portions. I didn't even touch my salad because the smoothie was so fulling, definitely a meal in itself. Towards the end of the work day I was getting hungry and decided to try some of the salad. I was asked if I wanted a balsamic or raspberry vinaigrette to go with the salad. I told the guy whatever tastes better and he told me that would be the raspberry vinaigrette. The salad was delicious. The kale was chopped up so finely that it really didn't have a taste so if you're not a huge fan of kale you might still like the salad. The portion was huge, it was good for 2 meals.   I try to eat healthy and like to support local businesses. Mojo Bowl definitely brings those two together for me. I can't wait to try more of their smoothies and food out soon!
816	1	a	"If you happen to get lost and wander by the gun show at the Coliseum, be sure to stop here. A little whole in the wall of a former Wendy's, this place rocks the steak taco world.  My favorite is the ""jaz"". Carne asada + cheese + peppers/onions = yum!!!  The barbacoa and chicken tacos are tasty, but I wouldn't say they'd knock you off your feet. Definitely go carne asada and defintely try this place."
912	1	a	I can't think of a better Thai rest. In PHX. Consistently good food and service.  They have Thai staples like rice paper rolls, Tom Ka Gai and Pad Thai as well as more creative items such as Crispy Mango Fish. Average Thai food pricing, free parking.  There are a good number of tables, so don't let a short line dissuade you.  Like any rest., scope your table before you sit to be sure it suits your mood.  Boisterous din in the main room when busy.
1533	0	a	"Cold, under done chips. If a Mexican food restaurant can not get this staple right how can I expect them to get much more right.  I arrived for a party that my autocross group was having. Every table had chips and salsa on it. Sombreros were used as the server platters. Senor I don't think this even meets health code.   Dinner was served Buffet Style, one of the dishes was called ""fandito."" I can't think of a less inspired dish. It was simple pasta with some Mexican flavors thrown it, a dish that your mother would make if she had leftovers from Mexican Italian nights.   I like really like Mexican food, however I left this place hungry as I did not even want to try any of the dishes other than the salad."
5294	1	a	I've only eaten the buffet here and it was good but nothing special.  To be fair, most Indian buffets are pretty similar, it's only when you order from the menu that you see if the restaurant is really a stand-out.  So, I will update this review when I've gone there for dinner
4420	1	a	After reading all the good reviews, we were looking forward to eating here, but we were a bit apprehensive due to the couple of bad reviews because of the smell. Bummer...the smell just killed it for us right from the get go. Immediately, upon walking in the door, the pungent smell of backed up sewer hit us like a ton-of-bricks. We did a 180 and walked right out. No way I could sit through a meal here while breathing that funk.   Get the smell worked out and we will give you another shot, Tasty Thai.
1329	1	a	"I can always count on Sacks.   It is always fresh and always tasty and the sandwiches are so creative that years later I'm still not sure how they get those fabulous blends and tastes that they do.   I try to hit lunch a little off the lunch hour and then the crowds are not so bad and I can find parking but, its worth it to eat a little latter when I know the meal will be so satisfying I can go back to work and be so productive.   Sacks is my ""go to place"" when I have a guest or friend that I want to be well fed and satisfied too."
5869	1	a	"I don't drink a lot of coffee, but I'm a fan of tea. Especially strange tea that I probably can't pronounce right. Oh, and I like it when it smells like scotch. Yep, I'm a fan of Lapsang Souchong.  But I'm not a fan of ""foofy"". And that's one thing that Tea infusion is not. It's not foofy. It's funky. It's fun. And everyone who works there is really friendly.  Beyond the teas, the food is good, too. I don't know that I'd eat there every night, but it's a wider variety than I'd expect at a tea place.  This is a regular stop of mine. Makes Tempe Markeplace worth it!"
3892	1	a	This place is for purists!  Be prepared for a great deal of questionable textured items if you order the tasting...Great sushi and sashimi however I would go to sakana sushi & grill for a true sashimi / sushi experience.
8029	1	a	I like their seating area. It has a nice sized inside area and also a bright outside area that is tucked between a walkway and another store. One of my favorite locations.
2310	1	a	Huge burritos for $7. Enough for 2 people.  Fresh and tasty!  Plus very friendly service.  I prefer going here vs the Taco Bell in front of them :)
8339	1	a	So last Monday the hubs and I got invited out to join some friends for $3 burgers at Maizies ($4 if you add cheese)  For 4 burgers (All with cheese on them) and 4 beers our total bill was only $30!!!!!!!! That is a smoking deal if I ever did see one!   Our burgers came out fast and hot. They serve them on chibata bread! They give you a little side of chipotle mayo that is delicious, but not enough to cover a burger.   Our waiter was super fast and friendly! We will for sure be going back
4401	1	a	"Popped in for a quick meal before a show. Fun decor, brand new and sparkling clean, with a nice sized menu. We chose this restaurant because it advertised gluten free pasta. Unfortunately, no one on staff seemed to know what ""gluten free"" meant. When we asked which sauces might be GF to go with the GF pasta, we were met with blank stares. It took several questions to determine that the marinara sauce ""might"" be GF -not very confidence inspiring. When we did get our meals, everything tasted fine, not fabulous, about on par with a Pei Wei type experience. I had a small side house salad, which was not on the menu, but was offered by the girl at the register.  The greens were nice, but not chilled, which was kind of yucky.  The balsamic vineagrette was not able to be GF certified, so I had it on the side.  It was just OK.  My GF pasta was cooked properly, and the portion was large but not too large.  I had the primavera with marinara sauce, and while the veggies seemed fresh, they were a tad overcooked.  My husband had a pizza, seemed to be pretty good.  My daughter had a kids meal of chicken tenders and fries--the tenders were a chicken breast cut into slices, which worked, and the fries were a tad bit reminiscent of Burger King's, with some parmesan thrown on top.  The kid's meal also came with mini donuts, which we had to ask for 3 times, but there were fresh out of the fryer and covered in cinammon sugar--yummy.  We ordered ice cream with a GF chocolate chip cookie--and what arrived was definitely not a ""cookie""--more like a gluey, gooey chocolate chip amoeba at the bottom of a dish with 2 scoops of ice cream on top.  Eh.  I tried to order an espresso machiato at the coffee bar in back of the restauant--the coffee girl didn't know the correct way to make the drink, so I opted for a soy cappucino--this was tasty and well done.   This is clearly a new business still working out the kinks. I think it's a good option if you're in downtown PHX and need a quick, decent meal."
5911	1	a	My boyfriend just reviewed this place and although we have never  been here together - I thought that I might chime in as well. I really enjoyed this little burger place.  It makes eating a burger seem fancy in a very modern setting.  I really LIKE the sweet potato french fries....Mmmmm!
1950	1	a	Had a family style meal and everything was delicious.  Rigatoni in a cream sauce with chicken was outstanding, as was the pound cake dessert.  Appetizer stuffed mushrooms were also really good.  On the pricey side, but nice for a special occasion.
